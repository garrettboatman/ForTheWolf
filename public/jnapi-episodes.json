So he's a little disappointed from a career standpoint but he's still gonna get the money from a friend.<br /><br />Jake: (laughed, stood up, deep spit breathe, sits down)<br /><br />Amir: What happened?<br /><br />Jake: Ugh, bullshit, really (background: cough cough). Uhh, didn't get the raise. Butts. You owe me nineteen hundred dollars.<br /><br />Amir: (laughed) Why is that?<br /><br />Jake: So we (background: Amir laugh)...we gotta bet.<br /><br />Amir: Nah, I was just kdding about that.<br /><br />Jake: I bet you that I wasn't gonna get a raise.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, no.

One, I'll be in the car.<br /><br />Amir: A guy who takes a drink out of his water and it taste like his own urine, and he wants to tell people that it taste like his own urine but he can't because then he would have to explain the fact that he's one drinks, that he's once drink his own pee and he doesn't wanna do that.<br /><br />Jake: (Drinking water, spits out the water) This taste...<br /><br />Amir: Like what?<br /><br />Jake: It taste like...cruUud.<br /><br />Jake: Guy who is been secretly collecting playboy magazines for twenty-five years and tries to sell them all of them on ebay without his wife knowing.<br /><br />Amir: Yes, every single issue...

'Coz if you're not gonna do it, baah then you shouldn't be holding a camera right now. I'm being serious. Like, honestly, don't even film this. I'm being completely serious right now. If you're not gonna take it seriously, I don't even wanna be part of this thing.

      "script": "Amir: All right, this is a 30 second debate between myself and Jake. Uh, Jake. What do you think about global warming? Do you think humans can slow it down or is it just an unstoppable force? Should we not even bother? Should we be like, You know what? I'm gonna drive my car and I'm gonna eat my gasoline and I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm an american?<br /><br />Jake: Incoherent fast talking<br /><br />Amir: I can't. I can't...let's do that again. I can't hear you when you do like fast forward talking. So just talk normal.<br /><br />Jake: More fast talking<br /><br />Amir: laughs You did it again. You talked..you talked like super fast, and I can't..nobody's gonna understand you.<br /><br />Jake: More fast talking<br /><br />Amir: laughs All right, let's just...stop it. Let's just do it later, 'cause I'm..I'm running late, so I have to go anyway. (Amir turns to leave, but as he starts walking, time slows down tremendously. Amir turns around)<br /><br />Amir: Stop it! I'm seriously late! (Amir turns and leaps forward, but time has slowed again)<br /><br />Amir: You're so annoying!<br /><br />END<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Jake's fast talking can be understood when the video is slowed down.<br /><br />First response: First of all, people don't eat gasoline. That's just a common misconception. And personally? I think we should just..let loose, you know? Drive our cars into the ozone layer. Eat garbage. Poop anywhere we want, like...the earth is fucked, and we're all going to be dead by the time global warming really takes effect, so, what's the point, right?<br /><br />Second response: I..I was talking pretty normally. I didn't...really don't think I did anything..like fast forwarding? That's..what the hell does that even mean?<br /><br />Third response: That's absurd. Not true at all. I don't..I'm talking [at a] very normal speed right now.<br /><br />",

What's that Jovi quote?<br /><br />Amir: I mean, I'm gonna tell you what it is because it's such a chill quote that it belongs with that screen name, but: She says we <br /><br />gotta hold on to what we got cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not. How could you do that? Like, you know I thought <br /><br />that was the chillest.<br /><br />Jake: What's Streeter's handle? I need to add him. I'm trying to flesh out this BL right now.<br /><br />Amir: I'm supposed to be the chill dude.<br /><br />Jake: Chill out, dude. All's fair in love and chill, you know that.<br /><br />",

Do you want me to..?<br /><br />Amir: The next......<br /><br />Jake: Am I supposed to finish that sentence for you?  <br /><br />Amir: Alright, first idea. You know how Barry Bonds is in the home run thing?

Okay. It would text you whenever anybody hits a homerun.  <br /><br />Amir: Facebook for college students.

I don't know what that meant. Any idea?<br /><br />Jake: Nope. It's your list. Just cross it off don't check it. There you go.  <br /><br />Amir: Funny chinese names.<br /><br />Jake: I mean, that's offensive and not a good idea.  <br /><br />Amir: Uh, an alphabetical database.<br /><br />Jake: Of what?<br /><br />Amir: Anything.<br /><br />Jake: Next.<br /><br />Amir: Okay.  <br /><br />Amir: Uh, IMDb but no actors.

I know you wanted me to use it to document what I do on a day-to-day basis, so I'm gonna do exactly that. This is my video letter to you. Usually, I start every day by going over to my best friend Jake's house, who lives right here. (Presses a button on a nearby apartment building to buzz Jake) He's expecting me.<br /><br />JAKE: (talking through the buzzer) Hello?<br /><br />AMIR: It's me!<br /><br />JAKE: What the hell are you doing here?<br /><br />AMIR: I know you wanted to see what I do on a day-to-day basis, so this is my video letter to you. Usually, I start every day by visiting my best friend Jake, who lives right here. (Buzzes Jake) He's expecting me.<br /><br />JAKE: (talking through the buzzer) Agh. Come on up.<br /><br />AMIR: See?<br /><br />(Amir knocks on Jake's apartment door. Jake opens it.)<br /><br />JAKE: You have twenty minutes.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, cut. Don't-<br /><br />(Amir, outside the apartment again, knocks shave and a haircut; Jake opens the door.)<br /><br />JAKE: Stay as long as you want.<br /><br />(AMIR knocks the first part of shave and a haircut; Jake opens, and does the two bits part vocally.)<br /><br />JAKE: Da da!<br /><br />(Amir enters, and turns the camera to a woman sitting on the couch)<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! Mara's here. (turns the camera to Jake) Kind of a third wheel, right?<br /><br />[Amir is facing the camera again]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake usually has food prepared for me when I get here. What's for brunch today, Jake? (Turns the camera to Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: Here you go. (Tosses a bag of buns to Amir)<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, come on. What is this?<br /><br />[Jake is preparing a bowl of cereal.]<br /><br />JAKE: Honey Nut Cheerios, your favorite.<br /><br />(Amir is sitting at the table, facing the camera)<br /><br />AMIR: Brunch was delicious! Now we usually see a movie. What's it today, partner-in-life?<br /><br />JAKE: Absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: Rush Hour 3?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on, man. Come on. (Puts the camera down) 20 bucks. 20 bucks for the movie.<br /><br />JAKE: 40.<br /><br />[Amir is facing the camera again]<br /><br />AMIR: Now we usually see a movie. What's it today, buddy?<br /><br />JAKE: It's Rush Hour 3.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow, Rush Hour 3. Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?<br /><br />JAKE: That's Rush Hour 1.<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are still at the table, the camera turned on Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: How was the movie, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: It was good.<br /><br />AMIR: What was your favorite part?<br /><br />JAKE: (unenthusiastically) The karate.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on.<br /><br />[Jake is in the bathroom talking to Mara, and Amir is surreptitiously filming them through the partially opened door.]<br /><br />AMIR: (to the camera) Mom, take a look. Jake and his girlfriend are in the bathroom together.<br /><br />Mara: I want him the FUCK out of here, Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, calm down! I'll tell him to leave right now.<br /><br />(Amir runs back to the kitchen.)<br /><br />AMIR: Um. Usually, we play videogames after the movie.<br /><br />[Amir is filming himself in the mirror, pretending to walk down nonexistent stairs; he notices Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: What's up man? Hey, uh, videogames.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, no. You gotta get out of here.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry, uh, you just gotta go.<br /><br />AMIR: What's up?<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing, it's just time to leave.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. Uh, totally, thank you so much for all this.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey listen... 100 bucks, and you can hug me.<br /><br />AMIR: 100 bucks for... and I get to hug you?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: On video. Definitely.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />AMIR: Hold this. (He hands Jake the camera; sounds of him counting money can be heard.) Alright, fine. I only have 80 left, but...<br /><br />Mara: Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: See you later.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on, man! I'll give you 20...<br /><br />JAKE: There's an ATM around the corner.<br /><br />Mara: Jake!<br /><br />AMIR: I'll be--<br /><br />JAKE: Go, quick.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll be back in, like, less than two minutes. Where is it?<br /><br />JAKE: Around the corner. This is still taping.<br /><br />AMIR: Turn it off, I'll be back--<br /><br />[Amir is talking to the camera, still in Jake's apartment.]<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, time to go! Uh, hold this. One second. (Gives the camera to Mara.) Later man. (Hugs Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: See you later.<br /><br />AMIR: Bye mom!<br /><br />(THANKS MOM displays, with Thong Song by Sisqó playing)<br /><br />[Mara is still holding the camera, pointing it at Amir. Amir is waving at Jake, who is off-camera.]<br /><br />AMIR: 20 for... 20, one shot waving.<br /><br />(Jake comes over and starts waving at the camera with Amir, while Amir fishes out a 20 dollar bill.)<br /><br />(Jake and Amir wave at the camera for a bit.)<br /><br />AMIR: Thank you so much.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to edit?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. No. I'll just put it in a timeline, and you export it. It's super easy. (Takes the camera back) How do you turn it off?<br /><br />JAKE: Right there. Top.<br /><br />",

I'm calling a deli. (Talking into the phone) Hi. Uh, can I have a turkey club? Uh, <br /><br />and...<br /><br />Amir: 30 medium pizzas.<br /><br />Jake: (To Amir) Instead of that.<br /><br />Amir: Jam.<br /><br />Jake: What kind of bread?<br /><br />Amir: No bread.<br /><br />Jake: That's disgusting, I'm not saying that.

One in the base of her spine. Two through her <br /><br />shoulderblades. You suspend her towards the roof, counterclockwise.

Not that you'd even care if I tried to kill me. Would you?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. Let's start from the ze-top. Filling out our men's basketball bracket. I'll start. Division I Men's Bracket Opening Round Game vs. March 18th. Who ya got?<br /><br />JAKE: Let's start lower with an actual team. North Carolina vs. Mount St. Mary.<br /><br />AMIR: 16 - 1 already. So, once you're up 20, there's no going back. I'd be a fool to go for North Carolina in this situation. M T S T Mary, thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, you can't do math. Also, this isn't a scoreboard. These are their seeds.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. Not gonna change my pick.<br /><br />JAKE: You are though. I'm watching you.<br /><br />AMIR: (Covering his bracket) Don't cheat.<br /><br />[Jump cut]<br /><br />AMIR: What'd you get for Indiana?<br /><br />JAKE: I just wrote Indiana.<br /><br />AMIR: Me too.

Okay, you can't (laughs) have them both, okay. So, I'll take Baylor and Perda over Zav-. How do you - when a word starts with an x, what is that?<br /><br />[Jump cut]<br /><br />AMIR: You smell super good today by the way bro.<br /><br />JAKE: C'mon.<br /><br />AMIR: What?!<br /><br />JAKE: That.<br /><br />[Jump cut]<br /><br />AMIR: St. Mary's and then also Mount St. Mary's. So, this bracket's already busted, right? So. Let me tear it and we'll start it from there. (Amir begins tearing his bracket)<br /><br />JAKE: Ok, Those - there are two St. Mary's teams.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, that's fine. I'll just tape it back together. It's not the first time I made that mistake.<br /><br />JAKE: You can tell.<br /><br />AMIR: What.

But, I have a feeling Mr. Hamilton (takes out $5 bill) will persuade the bracket masta.<br /><br />Jake takes $5 bill from Amir and throws it on the table.

I was kidding. He doesn't still love you. Get over it. <br /><br />MALLORY: There's been a misunderstanding. I need to leave. <br /><br />AMIR: Wait! You know Jake better than anyone else in the world other than me. What does one have to do to become better friends with him knowing full well that we're already best friends? <br /><br />MALLORY: If you let me leave, I'll tell you. <br /><br />AMIR: Interesting...<br /><br />[Amir steps aside, allowing Mallory to re-enter the elavator.]<br /><br />MALLORY: Well, Jake always wants what he can't have, so if you act really cold and really disinterested, he'll come to you. <br /><br />[Cut to Amir sitting back down at his desk, putting on his jacket hood]<br /><br />AMIR [rubbing his hands together]: Whew, Is it cold?

Maybe you want to go away with me this weekend? Going to Boston...chicken nugget festival. <br /><br />[Amir grimaces]<br /><br />AMIR: Auuughh! Why? Why would I want to do do that? Why would I want to go to a chicken nugget festival with you? That sounds terrible.<br /><br />JAKE: That's fine. We're just going to be eating french fries all day. And you know what? We're not going to be reading any books the entire weekend. <br /><br />AMIR [yelling]: Alright I'll fucking go!<br /><br />",

God, I don't know if it has a name but those luggages on wheels are the most convenient thing in the world. Like, I graduated college three years ago, and I find myself travelling a lot more, just--the difference between holding one of these luggages and rolling them? It's night and day. It's absolutely night and day. And these airports are so expansive! I mean, have you been to the new airport in Atlanta? Terminal A's on one side of the city, I feel like I need an airplane to get to the other side of the airport. I mean, it's just absolutely obscene. And--you know I'm a jogger. I mean, I like to jog. But the problem isn't the jogging, it's--it's stopping, right when I stop, I'm feeling this--this  tightness in my arch and in my toes. And, you know, I go to the orthopedic surgeon and he's telling me it's plain orphochitis and I want a second recommendation, it's just unbelievable what kind of--and I am blabbing so much about myself and I cannot believe how self-centered I've been. We should get some coffee one time this week. What are you doing on Thursday? I'm going to an opera or such, I don't know, some gay shit like that, it's just like a work in progress you know?

Hey, Jake! <br /><br />(Jake passes Pat and stands in front of the door to his room)<br /><br />JAKE: Look. I have to know. Did sarah talk to any guys last night?<br /><br />PAT: No, definitely not! Definitely not. <br /><br />(Sarah exits Pat's room, takes a few steps behind Jake and then turns around to go back into the room, door slams)<br /><br />JAKE: Thank god. (sighs) You know it's- What was that? <br /><br />PAT: Ah! A windy breeze blew through the- It's an old apartment--<br /><br />JAKE: That's fine. This whole Sarah thing is just really getting to me. <br /><br />PAT: Sarah thing? <br /><br />JAKE: Are you serious? You tried to cheer me up about it last night. <br /><br />PAT: Oh! <br /><br />JAKE: I'm stressed out because I'm in love with her. Oh my god. <br /><br />(Pat's door opens and Amir comes out wrapped in a towel)<br /><br />PAT: Oh my god!!<br /><br />(Sarah pulls amir back in) <br /><br />JAKE: I'm in love with her. <br /><br />AMIR: Jake was just talking mad smack about you, he was all like--<br /><br />SARAH: Shut up! He can't know I'm here!<br /><br />AMIR: What's the big deal? I crashed on the couch, you and Pat wrestled or whatever all night.

Sorry. It's not you, it's just the thought of Sarah with another guy- (punches Pat's door) You know? (yells)<br /><br />SARAH: Oh my god, this is awful. <br /><br />AMIR: Speak for yourself. (picks up a glass full of change) There's like $3,000 in here, do you know how much money I could buy with that? (begins pouring the coins slowly through the towel, as though hiding them away, they hit the hardwood, making a lot of noise) Shhh.<br /><br />PAT: (trying to cover the noise) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get mad Jake! Scream! Ahh!<br /><br />JAKE: Ahh!<br /><br />PAT: Ahh!<br /><br />JAKE: Ahh!<br /><br />PAT: Ahh!<br /><br />AMIR: AHH!! <br /><br />PAT: Keep screaming! <br /><br />JAKE: AHH! <br /><br />PAT: Scream!

It's - I mean it's pointless anyway because it's far away [sticks arm inside his blue polo shirt] it's never going to- <br /><br />Jake pushes his hand out the top of his polo. Because his arm is inside the shirt, it appears as though the hand is by itself.<br /><br />Jake: [fake frightened] OH NO!<br /><br />Amir sees the hand and begins screaming hysterically. He grabs the hand and shakes while he continues screaming. While Jake is yelling, Amir begins to cry.<br /><br />Jake: [fake frightened] Oh my god! It's headed for us!

There's nothing inside my shirt, right?<br /><br />Amir has his hands to his face. He is no longer crying, but he is still whimpering.

Smile like a big boy!<br /><br />Amir smiles widely with his teeth clenched. His eyes are squeezed shut. Jake rocks him gently.<br /><br />Jake: [Smiling and patting Amir on the back] Smile like a big boy! Huh? You wanna get ice cream?<br /><br />Amir: [still crying, shakes his head] No.<br /><br />Jake: No, K, [pats Amir on the shoulder] you're fine, you're gonna be okay. [looks up at the co-workers] He's fine. [waves off co-workers again]<br /><br />Amir: Boo! [laughs]<br /><br />Jake: Eh, hahaha! [puts his hands up as if he were surrendering]<br /><br />",

It was more of a web- web--<br /><br />ANDY: We almost called \"Incredibad\" \"Please Incredibad, Don't Hurt 'Em\", but then we called ourselves \"The Lonely Island\", so we just called the album \"Incredibad\".<br /><br />JORM: And also han--<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping loudly) Five o'clock in the morning, I hear the phone ringing (points to Jorm)<br /><br />JORM: ...Yo wuddup Dunn.<br /><br />AMIR: Whaddup son, sorry boy you sleeping?<br /><br />ANDY: (referring to Kiv) He's not gonna--<br /><br />KIV: No..<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping) Just finished reading this ill-ass novel...<br /><br />JORM: (unenthusiastically) Not the one about the girl who left her family back in Kabul<br /><br />AMIR: (butting in) family up in-- A little louder.

And then if I'm in that's two. So, it's like fifty-fifty at this point.<br /><br />ANDY: Right. So it's a tie.<br /><br />AMIR: Down the road, I join the group.<br /><br />JAKE: I wanna--.<br /><br />AMIR: Whatever, ok, that.. becomes a thing.<br /><br />ANDY: Right.<br /><br />AMIR: Let's say I start feuding with Jorm over here.<br /><br />ANDY: Right.<br /><br />KIV: Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: We start fighting, it's obviously, it's not gonna happen with me and Jorm.

And if so...

I'm surprised you didn't know that.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm surprised you think it's a coupon. <br /><br />AMIR: I mean, it's not like this physical coupon or whatever.

So, do you do this often?<br /><br />AMIR: No, you can't do it often! You can only do it once at every restaurant in the city. I mean, do you really not know that? <br /><br />JAKE: I guess I just feel bad cashing in these types of coupons. <br /><br />AMIR: Nah, don't feel bad.

(incoherent) and just Jake, I'd do it a lot more, OK...<br /><br />(Amir continues after Jake stops)<br /><br />AMIR: I'd do it a lot more, if I wasn't so afraid of smelling, tasting, seeing waitress blood and stuff like that.<br /><br />JAKE: OK, now I've lost my appetite. <br /><br />AMIR: Sorry about that, babe.<br /><br />THE END.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g46_qkAPNNA<br /><br />",

This is awesome! <br /><br />JAKE: (chuckling) Shit! I had no idea you could drink that much. Did you know you could drink that much?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, definitely. Why? How much though?<br /><br />JAKE: Try three bottles of vodka!  <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! I knew that! I could drink more than that. <br /><br />JAKE: I know you can because you had some fucking gin right afterwards!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh yeah, we had the gymnastics.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, they called you the gin guzzler, yo. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, they call me the gym guzzler, yo. <br /><br />JAKE: The gin guzzler.

You were shaking your shit around.<br /><br />(Amir is shaking about) <br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, everyone thought you looked like an asshole! <br /><br />(Amir abruptly stops)<br /><br />AMIR: OK.

(faces wall as if that's the girl)<br /><br />JAKE: All right, not me. And you were like 'Hey, babe.' you kissed her right on the mouth. <br /><br />(Amir acts as though he's going to make out with the wall)<br /><br />JAKE: That's what I'm talking about. And then she fucking PUKED!<br /><br />(Amir acts as though he's been puked on)<br /><br />AMIR: Ugh!<br /><br />JAKE: All over you, it was crazy! How do you not remember this? <br /><br />AMIR: I do, uh, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: You were fucking cussing her out. You were all pissed about it--<br /><br />AMIR: Stupid B. <br /><br />JAKE: --bouncer, he comes over and he's like 'Hey, you yelling at this girl?'--<br /><br />AMIR: (motioning as if there's a bouncer there) No! <br /><br />JAKE: --and then her boyfriend came over--<br /><br />AMIR: (now motioning to an invisible boyfriend) Hey, man! No, no, no.<br /><br />JAKE: Then, he flails you up against the wall--<br /><br />(Amir throws himself against the wall)<br /><br />JAKE: --and he's like 'I'm going to kick your ass' and you're fucking pleading with your eyes--<br /><br />(Amir is making a puppy face)<br /><br />JAKE: --please don't take my life, please don't take my life. You're begging him with your eyes and he- You're freakin' peeing your pants. You're pissing your pants. He felt bad for you and he just tossed you out on the curb.<br /><br />(Amir throws himself onto the floor) <br /><br />JAKE: You crawled back in and you were like 'Aw, fuck, please Jake, I need to get home--<br /><br />(Amir is miming along with Jake from the floor)<br /><br />JAKE: --let me borrow ten bucks to get home. Please, please, please.' Then I lent you ten bucks and I want that back now and I won't tell anybody about what happened last night. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, I only have a twenty. But why don't you take it, and you don't tell anybody about last night, twice. <br /><br />JAKE: Deal. (turns and walks down hallway) Hey, Rosie, movie is on me! (stops after a few steps and sighs) I feel bad. (turns and walks back to Amir) Let me get another twenty, I don't want to make him walk. We're going to take a cab. We're going to cab it. <br /><br />AMIR: You're going to cab it. <br /><br />JAKE: (taking the money forcefully from Amir's hand) We're going to cab it. <br /><br />THE END. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ivBBLxesJY<br /><br />",

So it was like... it was like a steal, you <br /><br />know?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, it was a steal. You stole it from me.<br /><br />Amir: Sure, stole it and sold it brotha, I mean it's highway robbery, you know? What are we even arguing about anymore?

I mean Jake still gets really annoyed. <br /><br />(Jake is seen walking in the hallway in the direction of Sarah and Pat.

I don't-I don't get what you're trying to do. <br /><br />AMIR: Basically, I thought I'd come in here, everybody would start losing their sheesh once they realized it's my halfie, and then instead of quelling them down 'cause everyone is so loud and stuff, I'd just remove my shirt and the message is displayed. <br /><br />JAKE: It's not even polite. <br /><br />AMIR: Well, I know. That's why I got Leron to write on my back, 'Thanks again everybody, sorry for making a scene but this is an office so let's all relax.'<br /><br />(Amir's back actually reads, 'Insert wang here' with a down arrow)<br /><br />JAKE: OK, that's not what that says. <br /><br />AMIR: What do you mean?<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't you at least double check in a mirror?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! But everything was all backwards so it was difficult to read. <br /><br />JAKE: I mean, there's a f***ing arrow.<br /><br />AMIR: I know,  I thought it was a letter.<br /><br />JAKE: Then you didn't know. You either knew, or you thought it was a letter. <br /><br />AMIR: Then I thought it was a letter. <br /><br />JAKE: OK, I know. Look, even if by some small miracle everybody in this office gave a s**t that it was your half birthday and they wanted to clap for you so loudly that you could even *ask* them to stop, if you needed to display a message on your chest, wouldn't you feel weird about admitting that you knew all of this all along? <br /><br />AMIR: I'm going to f***ing kill Leron if there's an arrow on my back, I swear. <br /><br />THE END. <br /><br />OUTRO<br /><br />AMIR: He's done, simple as that.

Jake and Amir are sitting at a desk in a hotel room. Jake has a deck of cards on the table.<br /><br />Jake: Blackjack is simple.<br /><br />Amir: Hey, that's a little racist for my taste. Maybe it shouldn't be a Jack, it should be a black, like a gangster.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, that's actually racist.<br /><br />Amir: Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.<br /><br />Jake: Right. The important thing to remember is that Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth ten.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, so how much is a ten worth?<br /><br />Jake: [hesitates] Ten.<br /><br />Amir looks upset at Jake.<br /><br />Jake: It's - okay.<br /><br />Amir slaps Jake across the face with his right hand. <br /><br />Amir: When were you going to tell me that?<br /><br />Jake and Amir are now playing with the cards. The cards are flat on the table so Jake can show Amir how to play.<br /><br />Jake: You have fifteen with the dealer showing ten. That would mean you want to hit.<br /><br />Amir raises his right arm and tries to slap Jake again, but this time Jake blocks Amir's hand with his arm and slams it on the table.<br /><br />Jake: Not me.<br /><br />Amir looks like he's in pain but moves his hand.<br /><br />Jake: I'm sorry.<br /><br />Amir: Nah, don't be. I messed up and you deserve to hit me.<br /><br />Jake: Okay<br /><br />Amir: I was kidding!<br /><br />Jake: Okay, you have a ten and a seven. How much is that worth?<br /><br />Amir: Thirty-one. Er! Twenty-one.<br /><br />Jake: No, seventeen.<br /><br />Amir: No. Yeah, seventeen. I thought you multiply them together or something.<br /><br />Jake: Would still be wrong.<br /><br />Amir: [annoyed] Ah!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: Still be right. Okay, I think I'm ready to go downstairs and play.<br /><br />Jake: How many cards are dealt?<br /><br />Amir: Uh, Queen.<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, just keep teaching me and stop being a dick about it? [flips the top card in the deck over]<br /><br />Amir is now holding the deck of cards in his hand.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, maybe we should learn how to count cards. [flips a card] One, [flips another card] two, [flips another card] Aahh! Um, okay, let's go back to basic strategy.<br /><br />Jake: That's a basic strategy. [Takes deck of cards from Amir]<br /><br />Amir: Yeah. <br /><br />Amir has the deck of cards. Jake is looking away from him with his arms on the table. He is exhausted and pissed off. Amir pulls a card from the deck and holds it up to Jake.<br /><br />Amir: Was this your card?<br /><br />Jake: They're all my cards. You made me pick every card. [Finally looks at card]<br /><br />Amir: [Looks at card] Just a yes or no, and then we'll move forward.<br /><br />Jake: Yes.<br /><br />Amir picks another card from the deck and shows it to Jake. Cut to Amir holding the deck in his left hand.<br /><br />Amir: And that's why they call me [hold up half to deck to Jake] the King of clubs.<br /><br />Jake: That's the seven of diamonds.<br /><br />Amir: I'm that - yes, I'm that too.<br /><br />Jake: You're a seven of diamonds?<br /><br />Cut to Amir jumping up and down on his bed. Jake is looking away again. The deck of cards has been abandoned on the table.<br /><br />Jake: You know I don't have to teach you anymore if you don't want.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, okay, just give me just five more minutes! T-bag.<br /><br />Amir jumps onto Jakes bed while Jake looks at him surprised.<br /><br />Jake: You know what? Let's play this instead. [Hold up deck] If it's red, say fire. If it's black, say smoke.<br /><br />Amir: Smoke.<br /><br />Jake puts that card down to reveal the next card.<br /><br />Amir: Fire.<br /><br />Jake shoots the deck at Amir and the cards fly into his face. Amir squeezes his eyes shut, then looks sadly at the disorganized cards. Jake smiles.<br /><br />Jake: Come on, it's funny.<br /><br />Amir still looks upset.<br /><br />Cut to Jake knocking on the bathroom door. He looks full of regret.<br /><br />Jake: Amir, are you there? I'm really sorry.<br /><br />Amir: [opens the door from the inside] I'm really sorry! Sorry for ever trusting you! [slams door] <br /><br />Jake sighs and covers his face with his left hand. Amir opens the door again.<br /><br />Amir: You still there?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I'm here.<br /><br />Amir: Okay.<br /><br />",

I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever.

The sky is blue because of.. the scattering like, sunlight fragmi--mints, and then, a prism, and, your human eyes.<br /><br />JAKE: That was smart. Even though you kinda went off into sentence fragments at the end there and made no coherent point, I think you're smart because you used big words. And then when you finished, you raised your eyebrows at me, which really solidified the point that you knew exactly what you were talking about.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, o- I mean on a sunny day, reighley scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, dark in the zenith and light near the.. horizon!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow. It sounded a lot like you were reading from Wikipedia, but I know for a fact that you couldn't have been because you were raising your eyes to look at me every few seconds to prove that you were speaking your own original thoughts.<br /><br />AMIR: Absolowly.<br /><br />JAKE: You mean absolutely.<br /><br />AMIR: (stumbling as he makes up a definition) No, uh, I mean absolowly, which is.. Franish for.. absolutely.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, ok. At first I thought you misspoke, but the way you spun it around on me, and me realize that I was wrong, makes you look smart, and me look stupider by comparison. (Amir makes a variety of strange faces). Especially because I didn't even know Franish was a language, but I know that it must be, because you said it with such conviction and confidence. Even now as I talk, you're just nodding your head, which makes me realize that you knew you were right all along--<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping) Yo yo SO, son, I wanna jump around and make ya go.... AAAH! (Amir's aaah noise)<br /><br />JAKE: That was a tight rap. (Amir continues making strange faces.) Normally raps have to rhyme, but you delivered it in such a way that made you seem like a professional freestyler. You know, even when you seemingly couldn't think of the next word you kind of just went aaah and shook your head, which made me realize that you were purposefully done talking. As a result, I'm your good friend now and I want to hang out more, take you to McDonald's and just generally hang you with you as much as possible.<br /><br />(Amir pumps his arms up and down with his palms upward.)<br /><br />JAKE: Now you're raising the roof, which I thought was outdated, but I know that it can't be outdated because you're doing it. I've grown to respect you so much in the last few minutes. I'm realizing you're not getting my sarcasm, even though I'm laying it on very thick.<br /><br />(Amiir squints and nods.)<br /><br />JAKE: Now you're squinting and nodding because you know you should be comprehending something, but you're still not.<br /><br />(Amir smiles.)<br /><br />JAKE: And now you're smiling because you think that I think that you understand--<br /><br />AMIR: (childishly impatient and exasperated) Are we gonna go the the Dees or not?!<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

Jake slams a large file down on the desk and sits down next to him]<br /><br />Jake: Hey! Do you mind explaining this?<br /><br />Amir: This? Oh that's [laughs] that is a menu to a Thai food restaurant<br /><br />Jake: That's what this is?<br /><br />Amir: Yiiiis<br /><br />Jake: Okay cool. Um, you can actually just say Thai restaurant, you don't have to say Thai food restaurant it accomplishes the exact same thing<br /><br />Amir: [laughs again] Oh yeah! I guess you're right. Okay, Peace out!<br /><br />Jake: [mockingly] Peace out!<br /><br />Amir: Peace in the middle ea-<br /><br />Jake: Because I thought what this was was a complete comprehensive list of every single outfit I've ever worn since I started working here<br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: No?<br /><br />Amir: No no, it's not.<br /><br />Jake: [While grabbing the first page from under Amir's hand] Do you mind if I refer to the first page here?<br /><br />Amir: Yah!<br /><br />Jake: Because here...

With a smiley face, so<br /><br />Amir: Okay, can we backtrack for like, half a second? I have a feeling that you can say Thai Food restaurant, you know what I mean? Yes it does sound a little redundant but I think, like I've heard Leron once-<br /><br />Jake: This is seriously fucking disturbing Amir! I know you're a weirdo. I get that! You're stupid, you're a moron, you're creepy, you're freakishly obsessed with me but this crosses the line. It's seriously fucked, it is. It's [Stutters the word 'It' repeatedly]<br /><br />Amir: IT'S IT'S IT'S TODAY JUNIOR!<br /><br />[Silence for almost a minute.

Amir has a sling on his right arm and 2 black eyes. He isn't wearing his glasses.<br /><br />Amir: So the nurse is like [closes nose] Sorry sir, we can't stay the night with you, even if you are afraid of the dark, [releases nose] and I'm like Bitch, you ain't going anywhere, there might be ghosts up in here so I grab her [grabs Jake's polo shirt] like-<br /><br />Jake: Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to tell me anything you might be embarrassed about.<br /><br />Amir: I'm not embarrassed about anything! So I grab her right [grabs Jake again] and she finally wrestles loose and she goes to call, I don't know, her supervisor or whatever [begins to rustle through Sarah's bag] but it's complete darkness in there so I start freaking out.<br /><br />Jake sees Amir going through Sarah's bag<br /><br />Jake: [Whispers angrily] Hey, hey, get your hand out of Sarah's bag OK? She is right there.<br /><br />Pan over to Sarah who is sitting at her desk wearing headphones and facing her computer. Pan back to Amir who continues going through the bag.<br /><br />Amir: [chuckles] What do I care? So you know it's complete darkness in there, I'm crying but it's starting to burn because [in a weird voice] my eyes are broken or whatever-<br /><br />Jake: Stay out of Sarah's bag<br /><br />At this moment Amir pulls a pink tampon out of Sarah's bag. He puts his hands up as if he were surrendering without noticing the tampon in his hand.<br /><br />Amir: OK, relax. [looks at tampon] Oh...<br /><br />Jake closes his eyes then massages his forehead.<br /><br />Jake: [Looks away] Put that away. Put that away. Put that away.<br /><br />Amir unwraps the tampon and smells it.<br /><br />Jake: Amir don't. [Massages forehead again] Do you know what that is? Do you know what it is?<br /><br />At this point Amir holds the tampon is his mouth. He is moving it around inside his mouth while moaning.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, oh, ahaha!<br /><br />Jake: Sarah! Hey, Sarah.<br /><br />The camera pans to Sarah again who turns around and sees Amir with the tampon in his mouth. <br /><br />Amir is now making gargling noises. <br /><br />Amir appears to be stuffing the tampon down his throat. <br /><br />The camera cuts to Jake with a confused look on his face.<br /><br />The camera cuts back to Amir who has closed his mouth on the tampon. The string at the end sticks out of his mouth.<br /><br />The camera cuts to Sarah who looks at Amir with disgust.<br /><br />The camera cuts back to Amir. (It is implied that) the tampon is completely inside his mouth now. He swallows. His face which was smiling before, now looks concerned and scared.<br /><br />Jake: Wow, are you ok?<br /><br />Amir: [speaks in wheezes] I'm fine.<br /><br />Jake: Good, so you're not choking or anything?<br /><br />Amir: [speaks in wheezes] Choking? Haha, don't make me laugh. [Laughs]<br /><br />Jake: [in unison with Amir's laugh, but with concern] Hahahahahaha, so you don't need the Heimlich?<br /><br />Amir: [still wheezing] Heimlich, what are you crazy? I'm gonna go get lunch [Jake nods], um, do you want anything?<br /><br />Jake: [Shakes his head] Nope. I don't.<br /><br />Amir: [wheezing] I'm going to peace on outta here [makes peace sign with his hands]<br /><br />Jake: Alright, peace out.<br /><br />Amir begins to wheel himself away, pushing Jake's chair in the process. Amir seems to be calm while Jake is still freaking out.<br /><br />Amir: But, oh, by the way, before I forget, [takes deep breath in] what's the name of that song that goes [starts dancing in his chair. Jake does the same, calmer now] Come my lady/come come my lady/you're my butterfly.<br /><br />At the same time:<br /><br />Jake: Sugar-<br /><br />Amir: [grabs Jake's shirt] I'M GONNA DIE!<br /><br />Jake quickly gets up while Amir wheezes and struggles to breathe. Jake goes around Amir and begins doing the modified Heimlich maneuver because Amir is in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Cut to Sarah who looks extra concerned.<br /><br />Cut back to Jake and Amir. Jake continues to do the Heimlich maneuver until the tampon falls out of Amir's mouth. Amir begins to struggle and cough. The tampon falls to the floor. Amir begins to breathe forcefully, still a little wheezing.<br /><br />Cut back to Sarah, who is still concerned.<br /><br />Jake: [relieved] God, that was close.<br /><br />Jake pats Amir on the back and ANOTHER tampon falls out of his mouth, then onto the floor. Jake and Sarah exchange confused looks.<br /><br />Amir: By the way it's Sugar Ray's Butterfly is the song.<br /><br />Jake: [shakes his head] That's not true.<br /><br />Amir: Yea, I know it's not.<br /><br />",

You don't need a dollar. You payed for one bag, right? Two came out, you ate <br /><br />one, you gave us one. Why do you need a dollar? This is—it's twenty cents more than you paid.<br /><br />Amir: You know what? You're right. Okay, I only need eighty cents, and this a dollar, so here we go. (Tears a fifth of the bill off and <br /><br />gives it to Dan) Thank you, keep the change.<br /><br />(Pat comes in)<br /><br />Pat: Hey guys, um, sorry to interrupt. Has anyone seen a bag of cookies? By any chance?<br /><br />Amir: Uh, no, not here, dude. Sorry about that Pat.<br /><br />Pat: No? Are you sure?<br /><br />Dan: Of course.<br /><br />Pat: Oh, totally separate incident: I'm missing eighty cents.<br /><br />",

I wanna eat chicken nuggets, you gotta pay 'cause I don't have cash. Anything is better, than me paying 'cause I don't have cash.

Aw I never get it right when I guess that! I'm like 0 (pronounced O) for lifetime.<br /><br />JAKE: Are you signing up yet?<br /><br />AMIR: No, ok? I'm not. I have too much to think about right now, I'm sorry.<br /><br />JAKE: Why? What do you have to think about?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm tired, ok, I'm stressed, I'm dizzy, I stay up at night coughing, I'm sneezing all the time, I feel like I have an ear infection because my ear really really really hurts and on top of all that, every time I inhale it feels like I'm swallowing a ton of bricks, so sorry if I don't want to deal with this right now.<br /><br />JAKE: It sounds like you are already really really sick and you should probably get health insurance.<br /><br />(Amir sneezes blood into his hands.)<br /><br />AMIR: Enough with the health insurance, ok? Please! You're obsessed!<br /><br />JAKE: You just sneezed blood; are you sure you're okay?<br /><br />AMIR: (starting to get dizzy) Compromise Alert. Eheh. Let's do... let me do dental with you today, and then if things go well, we shall do the full thing tomorrow, how about that?

All I want to do is be with you and if you maybe feel the same way my naked friend over there (points at Sam) is going to fake a seizure and we're going to bust him out of a hospital.  Now I know that sounds cliche but you have two options.  You can come with me to New York and live happy ever after, or you can stay down here in Miami making porn.  Either way just know I've always, always loved you.  <br /><br />ONE WEEK LATER<br /><br />(moaning from a porno is heard)<br /><br />Jake: I can't believe you stayed in Miami and had sex with Jamie (to Sam).<br /><br />Sam: Wait, wait, wait!<br /><br />Amir: This is the best part!<br /><br />Jamie (heard in the video) Now when you're done with that cake come over here and do me.<br /><br />Sam and Amir both laugh while Jake Utters his non verbal disgust.<br /><br />Amir: That's chocolate. <br /><br />",

What's nose candy?<br /><br />AMIR: Me and Dave snort sugar at lunch and it makes us happy for a little time and then we sort of flatten out and get a little depressed. <br /><br />JAKE: Sugar?<br /><br />DAVID: It's cocaine, dad. Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: You guys do cocaine during work?!<br /><br />AMIR: What's cocaine?<br /><br />DAVID: (chuckles) How do you not love this guy?<br /><br />JAKE: No, you're taking advantage of him, man!<br /><br />DAVID: All right, he's a grown man, man.

Went out on a limb there. Didn't really pan out. Sorry about that. Cool. Like a Harley or--?<br /><br />DAVID: Yeah, Harley. (David sits at his desk) <br /><br />JAKE: Davidson, that's nasty. That is cool, man. Umm, sweet, sweet, sweet. (calling after David) Still shouldn't do drugs though! That's messed up. Umm, tell you what.

We reanimate The Little Mermaid.<br /><br />ADAM(?): Nobody else stood up when they pitched ideas.<br /><br />AMIR: In 2D.<br /><br />JAKE: It was in 2D.<br /><br />AMIR: In 1D then. Huh? <br /><br />(Amir is now pacing around the table) <br /><br />AMIR: All right, the voice actor who plays Tony the Tiger thinks everything is 'Grrreat'!<br /><br />SARAH: Yeah, good idea.  I pitched that 20 minutes ago.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it went over pretty well. Didn't it?<br /><br />SARAH: Yeah. <br /><br />AMIR: BITCH! <br /><br />AMIR: (holding a yogurt) It's a commercial for yogurt.<br /><br />PAT: What's the joke?<br /><br />AMIR: You're the joke, if you don't like this rich yogurt. (takes a spoonful and then spits it out) I don't like it. <br /><br />AMIR: Few song parody ideas. (sings) They tried to make me sign on G-chat and I said yo, yo, yo. (pause, continues singing) I've got an orange, fruit, that tonight's going to be a good night. <br /><br />AMIR: All right, it's a frat house, but it's in 3900 B.C., what?!<br /><br />CALDWELL(?): Oh. That's kind of cool, so it's like campus Greeks versus ancient Greeks.<br /><br />AMIR: No, mine takes place in Rome and that's completely non-negotiable. So. <br /><br />AMIR: Wow. I'm bleeding.<br /><br />AMIR: What if roosters had watches? Haha, I think it would go a little something like this: clock-a-doodle-doooo. (pause) Swing and a miss from Blumenfeld. Ha. Get off the stage butt-head. Nah, that was a good idea. <br /><br />(Amir is by Kevin) <br /><br />AMIR: You know how sometimes people just forget how to eat? <br /><br />KEVIN: Nope.<br /><br />AMIR: OK. <br /><br />(Amir is standing behind Jake) <br /><br />AMIR: All right, one more, and Jake is already on board with this one in a major way.  <br /><br />JAKE: I'm not. <br /><br />AMIR: Well, you haven't even heard it yet.<br /><br />JAKE: Which is why I'm not on board. You are very close to me, man. <br /><br />(Amir singing the beginning tune of Bad Romance and pans out to show everyone has left but Jake)<br /><br />AMIR: La-la-oh-la-la. Ro-ma-ro-ma-ma. Ga-ga-oh-la-la, want your good orange. <br /><br />JAKE: Can we go?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes. <br /><br />THE END. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlZ8oiXv0y8<br /><br />",

Amir then makes a pose when Jake looks over.]<br /><br />Amir: Jake. I figured out a way to save time.<br /><br />Jake: By not talking during work?<br /><br />Amir: By wiping before you shit?<br /><br />Jake: How does that save you any time?<br /><br />Amir: How does what save you any time?<br /><br />Jake: [Jake takes a deep breath] I made a promise to myself that I wasn't going to get mad at you anymore, because it only stresses me out and it seems to have no effect on you. So...<br /><br />Amir: [Louder] How does what save you any time, though? How does what, [pause] save you any time, that is.<br /><br />Jake: How does wiping before you shit save you any time?<br /><br />Amir: It does.<br /><br />Jake: I would like to know how.<br /><br />Amir: And I'm telling you that it is, a time saver.<br /><br />Jake: I believe you that you believe it's a time saver.<br /><br />Amir: And I believe you, that you believe me, that is, because it is.<br /><br />Jake: Ok, but just tell me how it saves time.<br /><br />Amir: Ya just do it! You wipe, and then you shit.<br /><br />Jake: You're just explaining that you do it. [Amir nods] But you're not saying why it saves time.<br /><br />Amir: You don't have to because it does.<br /><br />Jake: Ok!<br /><br />Amir: Ok!<br /><br />Jake: That's fine!<br /><br />Amir: Hm hm!<br /><br />Jake: Good!<br /><br />Amir: [High-pitched] Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: All right.<br /><br />Amir: [High-pitched] Yep!<br /><br />Jake: I don't think it saves anytime but, we can agree to disagree.<br /><br />Amir: [Laughs] We can agree to agree because it does! AHH!<br /><br />Jake: We don't have to agree on everything and that's fine.<br /><br />Amir: [Laughing] It is fine, because it does.<br /><br />Jake: You are wrong sometimes.<br /><br />Amir: I am never wrong sometimes.<br /><br />Jake: Because this doesn't change the two things that you have to do which is shit and wipe. It just switches the order. Maybe if you didn't wipe at all, but...<br /><br />Amir: Yes but if you switch the order it makes it so time is saved so, ahh! [laughs]<br /><br />Jake: You don't switch the order of things and save time.<br /><br />Amir: [laughs] Yes I do.<br /><br />Jake: But, OK.<br /><br />Amir: Ok<br /><br />Jake: Ok<br /><br />Amir: It is Ok because it does save time.<br /><br />Jake: It doesn't save time.<br /><br />Amir: [Singing and pretending to play an instrument] It is ok because it does save time, It is ok because it does save time.<br /><br />Jake: [Joins in the song] Boop boop bedoop, It doesn't save time.<br /><br />Amir: [Still singing and playing] Yes it does, Yes it does.<br /><br />Jake: [Stops singing] Well, whatever. That's a bad song anyway. Ok.<br /><br />Amir: [Still singing] Yes it does it does save time, yes it does it does save time.

YOU'RE STILL WIPING, YOU'RE STILL SHITTING. YOU'RE STILL DOING BOTH THINGS.<br /><br />Amir: I can't breathe!<br /><br />Jake: EXPLAIN IT TO ME. EXPLAIN IT.<br /><br />Amir: LET GO! All I'm saying is that if you wipe before you shit there's not a lot of shit there so you don't have to wipe as much! That's it! It's a time saver!<br /><br />Jake: That's it? <br /><br />Amir: That's it, yeah.<br /><br />Jake: That's really unsanitary. But I can see how you might say that's a time saver.<br /><br />Amir: Because it saves time.<br /><br />Jake: It still doesn't make any sense but, I can see your logic.<br /><br />Amir: [nodding] What doesn't make sense?<br /><br />Jake: I'll kill you.<br /><br />Amir: GAHHH<br /><br />",

YOU should go back to poetry school. <br /><br />Jake: Don't just insult me, alright? God! It's easy to say un-this or un-that, but theres no un that's a positive that I could use in the video. <br /><br />Amir: What about... <br /><br />[Jump cut] <br /><br />Jake: U is for unyielding, in your unrelating love. <br /><br />Amir: unrelenting. <br /><br />Jake: What? <br /><br />Amir: Unrelenting. <br /><br />Jake: Unre- I said that, you f***! <br /><br />[Jump cut] <br /><br />Jake: U is for unyielding, in your unrelenting love.

This is a rough draft. <br /><br />Amir (still laughing): Still.

I'm sure she'd appreciate that. <br /><br />[Jump cut] <br /><br />Jake: R is for raising me. A gift that you continued to give me throughout my childhood.

No news is good new though.<br /><br />JAKE: Well there is news and its bad news.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah that's why... It proves my point.<br /><br />JAKE: I hate when you're accidentally right. <br /><br />JAKE: Basically there was an accident and there is a well pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean every single day.<br /><br />AMIR: What's the big deal, just stuff it with garbage, that's what I would do.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow they actually thought of that and it's insanely disappointing that you're coming up with the same solutions as they are.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah... disappointing for me? Err...<br /><br />JAKE: For the world.<br /><br />AMIR: For the wolf.<br /><br />JAKE: For the world.<br /><br />AMIR: I think the scariest thing isn't the rate at which the oil is spilling but rather spiders! Okay those things are freaky for real.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Yeah\" you agree or \"Yeah\" you're just getting me to shut up?<br /><br />AMIR: If you could change one thing about the oil spill what would it be...<br /><br />JAKE: The rig would never explode<br /><br />AMIR: ...and why? Hmm, little harder than you thought.<br /><br />AMIR: Soil, foil, Susan Boyle.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you go back to your desk?<br /><br />AMIR: Noil<br /><br />AMIR: Drill baby drill huh, more like kill baby krill.<br /><br />JAKE: That's actually kind of clever.<br /><br />AMIR: If only krill was a word.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay never mind.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah forget it. Forget it, it's got it, it's gone.<br /><br />JAKE: Yup.<br /><br />AMIR: There's this episode of Saved by the Bell where uh...<br /><br />JAKE: With the oil spill?<br /><br />AMIR: No the one where Zach impersonates a Russian chess player from Valley and let's Screech beat him.<br /><br />JAKE: Why would you bring that up now?<br /><br />AMIR: Cuz it's funny!<br /><br />AMIR: As sad as this whole oil spill thing is, it might be like the one catalyst that sort of springs us and the world in general to sort of think about alternative energy sources going forward.<br /><br />JAKE: You might be right, you might be right.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah... I'm just KIDDING you idiot! Haha you Carfucker I got you! Yeah how about an automobile that runs on ocean water so that when the ocean water spills into the ocean nobody gives a crap? How about...<br /><br />AMIR: You know this whole thing wouldn't be an issue if oil was more dense than water, like I suggested!<br /><br />AMIR: Ah no no no kay kay kay, here we go. How about an automobile that's run on stupid ideas so we can just hook a pump to your ass and you can fart out these shitty ill-conceived notions for the rest of time and we can just power every car in America for the next thirty years. How 'bout that! Or, what about, thinking solar for once.<br /><br />",

I'll go to a Yankee game anytime. (Amir chuckles) Hey, speed up a little bit, you're going like 8 miles per hour. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, what's the speed limit?<br /><br />JAKE: It's 65.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, I got a little wiggle room. <br /><br />JAKE: How'd you get the tickets, by the way?<br /><br />AMIR: Well they were super cheap. I guess no one wants to see the Reds play.  <br /><br />JAKE: Why not, dude? It's inter-league play, at Yankee Stadium, it's pretty cool.<br /><br />AMIR: (laughs) Not quite at Yankee Stadium, the game is in Cincinnati. <br /><br />JAKE: All right, pull over.<br /><br />AMIR: Da-nati. <br /><br />JAKE: Pull over, man.<br /><br />AMIR: The nati, shasta macnati. What's up?<br /><br />JAKE: I said pull over, all right? I don't want to go to Cincinnati. <br /><br />AMIR: We're almost there, relax! <br /><br />JAKE: We are not almost there, we just left, OK? And the game is in two hours, we're going to miss it.<br /><br />AMIR: We're not - (sighs). The game is not in two hours, check the date, it's in 26 hours, idiot. OK, so we're barely going to miss it.<br /><br />JAKE: But we're still missing the game. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, a little bit, but what's the big deal when you got (high pitched) the Overbeck Pottery Museum! <br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound like it's in Cincinnati, it sounds like it's in Overbeck. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well you're wrong, again, because it's not in either; it's in Cambridge City, Indiana, which sounds far away but it's actually only a six hour drive from Cincinnati, which means road trip #2!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, well I don't want to go on road trip number one, so just please pull over. <br /><br />AMIR: That's fine. You're just being a little bit of a buzz kill right now but what you need is a high level of the tickle monster! (lets go of wheel to try and tickle Jake)<br /><br />JAKE: OK, pull--Watch the road! Watch the road!<br /><br />AMIR: (grabs wheel again) Oh my god! <br /><br />JAKE:  Geez! You're going to kill both of us.  You're going to kill us.  Let me drive. <br /><br />AMIR: N-n-n-n-no. I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to get me to let go of the steering wheel. It's not  gonna happen, OK? I don't trust you. <br /><br />JAKE: (sighs) I know a short cut. <br /><br />AMIR: Do you? OK, let's stop right here then. <br /><br />(they pull into a parking lot and Amir gets out to walk around the van while Jake slides over inside)<br /><br />AMIR: (while walking around to other side) But I hope you realize that this move, this little switch, makes me the DJ of this party-mobile. That's right, all party tunes, all the time. Me and you, haha, OK, uh...<br /><br />(Jake pulls away while Amir is trying at the locked passenger door) <br /><br />AMIR: (on cell leaving voicemail) J.K., it's me, uh, (chuckles) you're an idiot. Look to your right, man.  You are going to realize that I am not there. (chuckles again)<br /><br />(cut)<br /><br />Mom, it's me, yeah, uh, I'm kind of stranded.<br /><br />(cuts back to leaving a voicemail)<br /><br />Jake, you are going to be such an idiot when you look and realize I'm not there anymore.  Come back, all right? Or call me, buh-bye. (tries calling again) Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. J.K.

I'm good.<br /><br />JAKE: Well you were on the toilet, and you were sleeping, so.<br /><br />AMIR: So yeah, I can see why you'd think that, based on all this (gesturing around).<br /><br />JAKE: Why is the door open?<br /><br />AMIR: Door is open because I um... (makes a door-closing gesture)... Alright FINE I was asleep, ok you caught me!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah I know you were asleep, but thank you for being honest on your second try; doesn't explain the door.<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, ok, I'm sorry, it's too early for this.<br /><br />JAKE: It's four in the afternoon.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, well the door is open because I fell asleep before I got a chance to close it, ok?<br /><br />JAKE: Ok, yeah, closing it should be the first thing you do, though.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it was going to be, but I (makes a snoring noise) zonked out.<br /><br />JAKE: Ya zonked out, well you had time to take your pants off, so I know you're lying.<br /><br />AMIR: (smiling) Ya caught me again. You BASTARD! Hahaha, you're on today! (Extends his arm for a high five.)<br /><br />JAKE: Don't.. try to touch me. It's not even that I'm mad. It's just that we were about to start a meeting, you excused yourself, you said I'll be back in one second, and I asked you where you were going, and you said I'm going to get everybody treats.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, no, the treats.<br /><br />JAKE: Nonono, don't.. worry about that. It's just, Ricky said that he didn't think it was such a good idea, and then you winked at him (Amir winks), and you said (in a silly voice) trust me, when I get back with these treats, it's gonna be a good idea, (Amir mouths the words along with Jake) and then he said Trust me, it's not, and then you said I will be back in thirty seconds, forty-five tops (Amir mouths the words), the treats are on my desk, I just forgot to bring them to the meeting. And that was forty-five minutes ago.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, that's because it's better to ask for forgiveness, than for permission.<br /><br />JAKE: Well you already asked for permission and he said no, so now you have to ask for both.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok. Just wipe me and we can go, please.<br /><br />JAKE: Sure, do you want me to wet the toilet paper?--<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, please wet the toilet paper--<br /><br />JAKE: Are you f***ing crazy, you think I'm gonna wipe you?<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

Yeah...<br /><br />Jake: (mocking Amir) It's not a toy; it's a 3D puzzle game, meah MEAH! You know what you sound like, man? Heh... Show me how to solve it.<br /><br />Amir: Show you?<br /><br />Jake: Just show me how to solve it.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, teach you how to solve the cube?<br /><br />Jake: No, no, no, what could you possibly teach me?<br /><br />Amir: Uh... how to.. solve it.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, well then why aren't you doing it?<br /><br />Amir: Um... I will. Okay, so basically, it's simple. The first step is—<br /><br />Jake: Amir, Amir, I know it's simple. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do it. [Jake smooches.]<br /><br />Amir: Right. I guess so. Uh, you don't know how to do it, though, so...<br /><br />Jake: Why don't you teach me how to do it; then I'll show you how well I can do it, a LOT weller than you could ever do it.<br /><br />Amir: Weller. Okay, uh, so the first step is to do the entire front face the same, so right now—<br /><br />Jake: And then all the other steps are getting all of the other blocks the same, right? Why don't you not tell me WHAT to do, but tell me HOW to do it? How! Now!<br /><br />Amir: Okay (said as Oh-kay)... uh, yeah. So, well, then it's not called blocks; it's called cubes.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, cool. You're gonna treat me like a baby, then I'mma leave.<br /><br />[Jake gets up halfway and pauses.]<br /><br />Jake: And you're not even gonna try to stop me.

And then, I was like, Oh, there's a lot more important things to worry about, like getting laid! So I became the master of that.<br /><br />Amir: ...Right. So this one's called Right Inverted, Down Inverted, Right, Down.<br /><br />Jake: I'm gonna beat you right down, if you don't slow down, right now, okay? All of that went right over my head.<br /><br />Amir: Right, well, we're getting close, so just pay attention.<br /><br />Jake: How random would it be if I just punched you in the head right now?<br /><br />[Jake starts raising his fist repeatedly.]<br /><br />Jake: Right, directly, in the skull. Knocked out your lights.<br /><br />Amir: Whoa.<br /><br />Jake: Scared? Scared? Who has the upper hand? 'Cause you know what, kid? There are book smarts, and there are street smarts. And I got both; you got neith—<br /><br />Amir: Done! Hehe.<br /><br />[Amir hands Jake the Rubik's Cube, gets up, and leaves out the door.]<br /><br />Jake: Wow, that took you, like, four hours. Congratulations, that was amazing. The—the slowest solving of the Rubik's Cube ever!<br /><br />[Jake gets up and moves to the door.]<br /><br />Jake: Wow, check it out! I got—yo, I solved the cube! Everybody!<br /><br />[Jake tries to turn the door knob.]<br /><br />Jake: Very funny; who locked the door?<br /><br />[Jake is still locked in the room.]<br /><br />Jake: I might run out of air in here!<br /><br />[Jake takes out his phone.]<br /><br />Jake: (high-pitched voice) Oh no!

You said I could pose like that for inspiration, but the actual masterpiece would be of me and Jake on a tandem bike or a skateboard.<br /><br />Painter: You're gonna be on a tandem bicycle, but I'm gonna warn you, it's gonna be hard drawin him on a bicycle, what with all that **** in the gears.<br /><br />Amir: Have mercy.<br /><br />Jake: Stop. Look, your plan was to give me this painting?<br /><br />Amir: No, my plan was to auction off the painting and split the money with you, 80-20 huh. Now I'm starting to have serious doubts.

I'll introduce the videos, if and only if--<br /><br />Jake - Time's up. <br /><br />Amir - Dang it. <br /><br />AMIR: Babe .  .  .  baaaabe.<br /><br />JAKE: I really hope you're not talking to me. <br /><br />AMIR: I'm not.  Did you get the letter I sent you, babe?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't. Did you send me a letter?<br /><br />AMIR: I did. I did send you a letter, and let me know when you get it because there's a couple things that I want to clarify.  Firstly, in the opening paragraph--<br /><br />JAKE: I said I didn't get the letter.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, just let me know when you do because I left some things intentionally ambiguous. <br /><br />JAKE: Why would you intentionally leave things ambiguous?<br /><br />AMIR: So that I could clarify them later. Oooh!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, well I'll let you know.  <br /><br />AMIR: Please do. Please do-do. (chuckles) Please do-do, but not in my tea, or in my coffee! Haha, no. <br /><br />JAKE: Where'd you send it? Where'd you send the letter? What name and address did you put on it?  Cool, so I'm not going to get the letter. <br /><br />AMIR: Oh. You'll get the letter.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not going to get the letter, not if you didn't put a name and address on the envelope. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, I don't want to argue with you anymore about this stupid letter!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, you shouldn't.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, you're going to get it, and we're going to laugh. And we're going to laugh and we're going to crack up when you read it. <br /><br />JAKE: Even if I did get the letter--<br /><br />AMIR: Which you will.<br /><br />JAKE: --I don't think I'd laugh about it. I definitely wouldn't crack up. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, forget it. I'm going to change the subject. (pause) What do you think is in the letter?<br /><br />JAKE: How is that changing the subject?<br /><br />AMIR: (rapidly) Because before we were talking about whether or not you would get it and now we're talking about the contents of the letter. <br /><br />JAKE: Still sounds like we're talking about the letter. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well I'm not going to not talk about the letter, I want to talk about the letter!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, you know what? I got the letter.  I got the letter and it's at home and I'll read it and we'll talk about it tomorrow. <br /><br />AMIR: You didn't get the letter.<br /><br />JAKE: How do you know that?<br /><br />AMIR: Because I never sent a letter!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my god!<br /><br />AMIR: You placate me too often.  I address that in the letter.  (pause) Somewhat ambiguously, but I would clarify it later. (pause) Any odds you already got it? <br /><br />THE END.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmFx7Eoe34A<br /><br />",

Our bodies are now the same, our souls however, have switched. Haven't you ever seen Freaky Friday?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Incorrect! I have, so thus, you have. You saw it at a Best Buy.  You cried at the end. <br /><br />JAKE: I was on the phone with my landlord. <br /><br />AMIR: My landlord. <br /><br />JAKE: And I might get kicked out of my apartment. <br /><br />AMIR: My apartment. <br /><br />JAKE: So I need to call him back, right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Call me back . . . later.<br /><br />JAKE: OK, that one didn't even make any sense. <br /><br />AMIR: Hm, blame yourself, I'm you. <br /><br />JAKE: If you're me, then what's my ATM pin number?<br /><br />AMIR: 5559<br /><br />JAKE: SHHH-All right.

He immediately resorts to breathing through his nose. Jake reaches over and plugs Amir's nose. Amir begins panicking and flailing around, then opens his mouth to breathe.]<br /><br />AMIR: What the hell was that?<br /><br />JAKE: You're clearly cheating.<br /><br />AMIR: You're a f**king narc.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, attempt number one.<br /><br />[Amir cracks his knuckles, inhales sharply, and then holds his breath. This time, he also plugs his own nose. He stands in silence for a few seconds.

[tries to find the right button] Which one?<br /><br />JAKE: That.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, attempt number one.<br /><br />[Amir inhales sharply. This time, he pinches his nose as well as his lips, so that there is no way to breathe. After a second or two, he slightly releases pressure from his lips. The air-sucking sound is very loud and obvious.]<br /><br />JAKE: God, that's worse than before. Cut.<br /><br />[Jake hits the button lightly; it doesn't cut.]<br /><br />AMIR: Rrrrgh.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright: what are you doing?<br /><br />AMIR: We can always ed--... th-- edit that part out.<br /><br />JAKE: Why edit? Why cheat? Why are you trying to cheat?<br /><br />AMIR: Because I'm trying to-- make it impressive; I wanna get in the Book.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, let's just do one honest attempt. Okay? No cheating.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Okay. No cheating.<br /><br />JAKE: No cheating.<br /><br />AMIR: Start.<br /><br />JAKE: Ready?<br /><br />[Amir has collapsed, and is breathing deep gasps of air. Jake is helping him to his feet.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God!<br /><br />AMIR: Cut it!<br /><br />JAKE: I cut it. I cut it.<br /><br />AMIR: Aaaah, I browned out!<br /><br />JAKE: You browned out!

But maybe I'm just overanalyzing it and you might.<br /><br />JAKE: Nope! You're not overanalyzing it. I'm not going to send you an e-mail.<br /><br />AMIR: Is it because you're going to feel like a dill-weed because I called you out on it and you wanted that e-mail to surprise me? Because I can tell you that I can act surprised.  In fact, the fact that I'm doubting you will make me actually surprised.  It's kind of ironic, right? Kind of one of life's little beautiful moments.  Don't you love life like that? These little moments that are sort of indescribable except for the two people that are experiencing it at the same --<br /><br />JAKE: OK, I just sent you an e-mail. <br /><br />AMIR: Oh.

I don't wanna die!<br /><br />Amir: (Jake still crying) What is wrong with you, man? I'm not actually trying to (Amir reaches for Jake's pocket) TAKE—TAKE YOUR WALLET! GIMME YOUR WALLET, man! GIMME YOUR WALLET!<br /><br />Jake: (crying, trying to hold back Amir) Stop it! Stop!<br /><br />Amir: (holding wallet) This is your wallet?<br /><br />Jake: (taking back wallet) He didn't even get my wallet...<br /><br />Amir: What did he steal—he stole your phone or something?<br /><br />Jake: No, he took my gym bag, but I had stuff in there. I had mesh shorts, I had a juice in there—my house keys! He took— (looks at pocket)<br /><br />Amir: (pointing) I can see them...<br /><br />Jake: (holding keys) They're here. They're fine, but everything else...<br /><br />Amir: Oh, so he took your juice...<br /><br />[Jake checks pocket again.]<br /><br />Amir: Oh.<br /><br />Jake: (holding juice) It's here. I—I put it in my pocket; I forgot—but this is not as full as I remember it.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, you think he took it out and then took a sip of it—<br /><br />Jake: I don't know. I don't know, 'cause it happened so fast.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, which is probably more of a reason that he didn't stop to sip your cranberry juice, man...<br /><br />Jake: (raises arms) Okay, well, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.<br /><br />Amir: (raises Jake's shirt) Okay, I can see you're wearing mesh shorts!<br /><br />Jake: All right, fine. Thank god I put them on, and he didn't get the mesh shorts; he took my gym bag.<br /><br />Amir: You—Can't you just get a new gym bag? I don't understand...<br /><br />Jake: Well, yeah, they give 'em away for free at the gym, but he'll probably just steal it again.<br /><br />Amir: Who would steal a gym bag?<br /><br />Jake: I don't know, man; he's, like, eleven. They don't care about anything.<br /><br />Amir: (pause) You got mugged by an eleven-year-old.<br /><br />Jake: (sighs) She rode her bike by and just swiped—<br /><br />Amir: She—she rode—so it was an eleven-year-old girl that—<br /><br />Jake: You're being an asshole. You're being incredibly insensitive, and I can't talk to you like this. (walks away)<br /><br />Amir: (pointing) Okay, right there. That's your gym bag; it's attached to your belt.<br /><br />Jake: (holding gym bag) I swear to god she made a legit swipe at this; that little bitch tried to jack me, all right? (grabs juice) And this juice: it was full; it was unopened!<br /><br />Jake: (talking on phone) And the mugger tried and tried and said, Gimme all your money! And I said, NO! Not today, you motherfucker! And then  he said... Nope! Not gonna tell you! (laughs) Means you gotta call me back. All right. Love you, Dad. Bye.<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

Can you delete some of the things you posted on his wall?<br /><br />Amir: What's- what things-what's some things?<br /><br />Jake: Sorry, that wasn't a question. Delete everything you've ever posted on his wall before.<br /><br />Amir: Uh, he's nineteen years old dude. Cut the cord. <br /><br />Jake: He's seventeen.<br /><br />Amir: Dude lied to me then. <br /><br />Jake: Did he lie to you or did you maybe just read his birthday wrong on his page?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah maybe that's it. <br /><br />Jake: That's it. Some of these things are like offensive and others are just annoying.<br /><br />Amir: Give me one example of each.<br /><br />Jake: Here's an example of both. 'Hey did you get my poke? Poke me back if you got it, playa. Hey, my last poke said poke me back if you got it, playa. But, everybody has poke so I'm expecting one unless you're a faggot.'<br /><br />Amir shrugs. <br /><br />Jake: What is that?<br /><br />Amir: A poke, it's like 'Hey, I got your attention but I don't have to write on your wall about it, just a way of saying...'<br /><br />Jake: Delete your Facebook.<br /><br />Amir: (clicks) Done.<br /><br />Jake: You didn't do anything. You just signed his wall again 'Hey, your big bro is acting like a toolbox extraordinary. Don't get mad if I piss on his jeans tonight.'<br /><br />Amir: A lot of these are just inside jokes between us so, butt it out. <br /><br />Jake: Well I just clicked on your wall to wall and he hasn't signed yours once and you leave him like videos like this. (Jake plays video) \"Micah, it's Amir. It's two am on a Wednesday. Poke that bitch or we're done! (laughs) Nah, no that was a joke but this is very serious. Call me right now. Your brother's hurt.\"<br /><br />Amir: Are you still pissed about the last time he visited?<br /><br />Jake: You mean when he went to get a drink from the water fountain and you shoved his face into it? Yeah, he lost two of his front teeth. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, I apologized for that.<br /><br />Jake: You said: 'Sorry you don't have a sense of humor, bitch.' <br /><br />Amir: And I genuinely meant that. Okay, I am sorry. I feel really badly that he doesn't have a sense of humor. Wh- What can I do? I can't go back and give him a sense of humor. It is what it is. I apologized.<br /><br />Jake: Just leave him alone, okay?<br /><br />Amir: Fine.

I overdid it at brunch yesterday.<br /><br />Jake: You thought you could eat all of this food at brunch?<br /><br />Amir: I jokingly said to waitress yesterday at brunch, Hey, one of everything please. She starts giggling, there's a chemistry there, <br /><br />so I smile at her, but I grab her forearm and I go, Hey, that wasn't a joke. I want one of everything, bitch. She takes me at face <br /><br />value because, you know, duality of man or whatever. Bitch starts bringing out plate by plate for like an hour and a half! We're going <br /><br />nuts! The whole restaurant's just up in arms. They start adding tables, because I'm at table for one, right, so there's not enough <br /><br />room, there's not enough area to support all these plates. After every plate she's like, Are you sure you can afford all this stuff? <br /><br />Because, you know, you've seen me on Saturday nights, I'm dressed like a vagrant or whatever. But I go, Hey, not only am I sure I'm <br /><br />gonna pay you for all this stuff, but there's a tip in it for you. I start losing it, I am going nuts, this is crazy right? At 11:30 I <br /><br />say eff it, I'm liveblogging the thing. It's going crazy, the Twitter sphere is just abuzz with this stuff. We're getting retweets, <br /><br />comments on my message board, it's absolutely ridonculous. We're going crazy in there! All of a sudden I start feeling like I'm in a <br /><br />fucking gameshow or something—<br /><br />Jake: What gameshow?<br /><br />Amir: Alright, long story shirt, I'll give you a blintz for 11 bucks instead of 12 if you promise to throw in a little extra for the <br /><br />huevos rancheros.<br /><br />Jake: Why would I pay you for your huevos rancheros?<br /><br />Amir: Alright lemme level with you man, because you're obviously not getting it. I can't afford to eat 500 dollars every time I go out. <br /><br />I can't have that on my conscience, I can't have that on my card. So, this is what I'm gonna say to you: I finish all this food in <br /><br />three minutes or less, you pay me for it. If I don't? Okay, I'll pay you double of what I paid.<br /><br />Jake: Fine.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, fine. (Takes a bite of the omelette) Ugh! I'm sorry, no. This is—(spits it out) this is too salty.<br /><br />",

I'm on Facebook Chat with this little twerp from Allentown. Now he's telling me that I have to pay for my own train ticket out there. Okay, so, how do I get back? Do I ask his dad for a ride? Clearly not because his dad's already pissed at me for talking to the 13-year-old while he's at school.<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you wearing a dress?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, all right, all right. How long have you been sitting on that question, Hurwitz? What else?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm serious. It's Thursday, it's not Halloween. There's no Halloween-<br /><br />AMIR: Laundry Day.

You just took me on a guilt trip.  Hey, that's pretty neat. Best part of all, I didn't have to drop 40K on that.

It's sweater: the movie. <br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: So you know how every good movie is just a combination of two other movies? <br /><br />JAKE: No. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, so you're definitely not going to like Fever Hitch. <br /><br />AMIR: This one is based on a script. <br /><br />JAKE: All movies are based on a script.<br /><br />AMIR: Not documentaries! (flips paper in notepad) OK, so it's a documentary about scripts, right? <br /><br />AMIR: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Fast, and Too Furious. No.<br /><br />AMIR: Stewart Thinkpen was an average guy--<br /><br />JAKE: Pass. <br /><br />AMIR: Argh, sorry, just took me forever to perfect that voice. (hits Jake)<br /><br />JAKE: Ow-ow!<br /><br />AMIR: Harold and Maud and Kumar. OK. <br /><br />AMIR: Oh! If you liked the sweater movie--<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't. <br /><br />AMIR: --Well, let me get through the freaking pitch without you tainting it with your negativity! Sweater 2: The Jacketing. <br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />(Amir is picking skin off his burnt face)<br /><br />JAKE: Hey man, will you not do that right now? <br /><br />AMIR: It's like, a lot of it is just dead skin.   <br /><br />AMIR: American Beauty and the Beast. (chuckles) Just give me something man.  <br /><br />AMIR: She was a girl who had all the answers. He was the boy who had just one big question. And then--argh, I've got nothing. If you've got something, that'll help me out a lot. <br /><br />JAKE: Well, let's just pass on it for now. <br /><br />AMIR: All right. Maybe piling it. (draws a circle on the pad)<br /><br />AMIR: The Sisterhood of the Traveling Antz, with a 'Z'. <br /><br />JAKE: No. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, maybe. (circles on pad)<br /><br />JAKE: That's--Sorry. So the circles mean maybe? Because you've circled every single idea I've said no to. <br /><br />AMIR: The Talented Mr. Ripley's Believe It Or Not. <br /><br />JAKE: That one is not even a movie. <br /><br />AMIR: Not yet. These are pit-- Oh, I see. Rip--Yeah. Maybe. <br /><br />AMIR: Uh, all right. I think that went well. <br /><br />JAKE: It didn't. I said no to literally everything you pitched. <br /><br />AMIR: Well, now I know what you don't want to hear, so that I can sort of re-imagine everything--<br /><br />JAKE: Don't think of any more movie ideas, all right? Man, you're really bad at it and I would quit entirely. <br /><br />AMIR: Ouch. (chuckles) That is a tough pill to swallow. Heh, you got to understand that I was really jazzed about these ideas last night. I was like air-boxing with no one, writing them down, getting super jazzed. So for me to hear that, that's tough man. That's tough for me to hear. <br /><br />AMIR: (sigh) I guarantee that if you knew what you were saying to me, if you knew how much that would affect me, that you wouldn't have said half the stuff you just said. <br /><br />JAKE: I think I'm going to go. (gets up and leaves shot)<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I think I'm going to peace out too. I might take a personal day because I feel like there's a--<br /><br />JAKE: Well you just got back from a two and a half week long Mexican vacation. <br /><br />AMIR: STAYCATION! And--(falls back into couch) You're right. Why'd you say that stuff, man? <br /><br />THE END.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dv43UUPJ4s<br /><br />",

(to Jake) Hey, what's up?<br /><br />JAKE: Were you waiting for me by the elevator?<br /><br />AMIR: No! I was talking to my friend Raymond and then he had to leave the second that you got here.<br /><br />Jake and Amir start walking to their desks.<br /><br />AMIR: Anyway, what have you done today?<br /><br />JAKE: So far? I woke up...<br /><br />AMIR: Same.<br /><br />JAKE: ...got dressed...<br /><br />AMIR: Same same.<br /><br />JAKE: ...came to work.<br /><br />AMIR: Same same same, triple same, knasty knasty.

Why do you have to question on what?<br /><br />They stop walking.<br /><br />JAKE: What is that?<br /><br />Jake's desk is wrapped in toilet paper.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! Cowards!

It's wet!<br /><br />Amir grabs a water bottle and starts pouring water on the paper. Jake stops him.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, hey! You're doing that! Did you do this?<br /><br />AMIR: (talking fast) No, I couldn't have done this, because earlier this morning I went pet shopping with my friend Raymond from earlier, and then we both got a hamster and went to my apartment and then we got to work at the same time. My hamster's name is... (looks at the desk) Toilet Paper, and toilet paper...<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't ask you the hamster's name, and wow, you should have thought of a name that didn't sound like toilet paper.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, let's just blow today. Can't we just take a personal day and go for a picnic or something? I'm sure the bandit left us some sandwiches and a frisbee. <br /><br />JAKE: He didn't.<br /><br />AMIR: Check under your desk maybe it's there.<br /><br />Jake checks under the desk.<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing.<br /><br />Amir checks under the desk.<br /><br />AMIR: What!? No! How..? Who... who did... THIS (pointing at the desk)... it's what I'm pissed about.<br /><br />JAKE: The toilet paper?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Well, you know what? The bandit must have left the food and the frisbee at my apartment earlier today because he was distracted, busy with the scheming of things, so why don't we swing by my apartment and then the bandit might have to take a dump real quick.<br /><br />JAKE: The bandit or you?<br /><br />AMIR: (sighs) Alright, just cut me some slack man, at least I'm trying.<br /><br />JAKE: You're lying.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm lying because you don't trust me ever. <br /><br />JAKE: How can I trust you? You lie all the time!<br /><br />AMIR: Why tell the truth to someone who always thinks you're lying?<br /><br />Jake looks confused.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, you want the truth? The truth is I just wanted to hang out with you, okay? I'm sorry, I wanted to go on a picnic with you. But then... this bandit! (grabs toilet paper) With this joke, this prank just ruined everything! Let's just... let's get out of here, man. Let's just forget it. Let's set it and forget it.

Where are you?<br /><br />AMIR: (on the other end, appears to be in a prison) Good good, man. How are you?<br /><br />JAKE: I said 'where are you?'.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm fine. I'm better than fine, actually. I'm great. Hey, uh, could you do me a flavor? (laughs) No, I said flavor instead of favor but could you go into my drawer and pull out one of the pieces of paper that's there? <br /><br />JAKE: Wow, these are a lot of reckless driving tickets. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, could you go like five minutes without editorializing? <br /><br />JAKE: Sorry, but I'm just saying--<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious, I was talking to Sarah and like we both agree that you never say anything plainly. You always have to like, have the last word and it just, it gets really tiring. <br /><br />JAKE: OK, I'm going to hang up. <br /><br />AMIR: W-w-wait! Could you find one that says 'oh, good driving sir. We owe you eleven hundred dollars'? And please do it without adding your two cents for once. <br /><br />JAKE: OK, there's one that says you owe them eleven hundred dollars. <br /><br />AMIR: No, that's not it. Keep looking. Keep looking for the one where it says they owe me the cash. <br /><br />JAKE: Just...before I keep looking, police don't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: You sure about that? Like is that a fact or is this another case of the Jake's, where you just keep on talking to hear the sound of your own voice because honestly, if it's the latter--<br /><br />JAKE: It's fact.<br /><br />AMIR: Bitches and cream, that blows. <br /><br />JAKE: You have tickets. You owe the police money. A lot of money. <br /><br />AMIR: Fu-udge-sicles. Anyways, how was your weekend? <br /><br />JAKE: It's Tuesday afternoon!<br /><br />AMIR: Good good, yeah, mine was bad. Really bad, actually. I got arrested for doing 90 in a zero. <br /><br />JAKE: A zero?<br /><br />AMIR: Well there's no like sign or anything but it was a freakin' kindergarden so yeah, I think you're supposed to go zero! <br /><br />JAKE: Look, I know this is a small thing to bring up but before, when you first called and I said 'where are you?' and you thought I said 'how are you?' . . . you said you were good.  <br /><br />AMIR: OK, please don't do this now, OK? I'm being held without bail, so it would be really nice just to hear someone say that it is not my fault. <br /><br />JAKE: I do think it's your fault. <br /><br />AMIR: There you go again with the talkie-talkie! You sound like the freakin' cop that I punched. Hey, what was the name of that song...?<br /><br />JAKE: I whip my hair back and forth. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes. That's the one.

In the bathroom. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, you just left your desk two minutes ago and you didn't say anything. <br /><br />Jake: I said I'd be right back! <br /><br />Amir: sighs What does that mean? <br /><br />Jake: It means I'll be right back and not to follow me to the bathroom. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, should I chill out here, or you want me to wait for you? <br /><br />Jake: Just chi- Okay, I see what you did. Neither. Alright? Just go away. <br /><br />Amir: Hey! Let me in, okay? Somebody's coming. <br /><br />Jake: No. <br /><br />(Amir scoffs. coworker enters the bathroom) <br /><br />Amir (in a Boston accent): Hey! Get outta here! Nobody's takin' a poop here! Mind your own bees! <br /><br />(Coworker leaves) <br /><br />Jake: Hey, whoever that is, don't worry, you can go to the bathroom. It's fine. <br /><br />Amir: He already left. <br /><br />Jake: Come on man. We have to work here, right? <br /><br />Amir: How much longer do you have in there? <br /><br />Jake: I don't know, alright? I can't exactly go to the bathroom with you here talking to me. <br /><br />Amir: Fine, fine. I'll stay, but I won't say anything. <br /><br />Jake: That makes no sense, but fine. <br /><br />(Brief silence broken by Amir making a high pitched noise.)<br /><br />Amir: Hey, I read on Yahoo News that laptops are cooking people's- <br /><br />Jake (interrupting Amir): Hey man, you just said you weren't gonna say anything. <br /><br />Amir: Alright, fine, okay? Keep it mum, alright? Mum's the word. <br /><br />Jake: Thank you. <br /><br />Amir (To the tune of War by Edwin Starr): Mum! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing! <br /><br />(Amir kicks in the stall door and falls to the floor) <br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ, man! What is wrong with you? <br /><br />Amir: Me? You said no talking! That was a kick! <br /><br />Jake: Yeah, you were singing! <br /><br />Amir: Oh my god! Singing isn't talking. <br /><br />Jake: Yes it is! <br /><br />Amir: Why do I- Why do I bother? Why do I bother if you're just not gonna like it? <br /><br />[After College Humor logo, Amir is still on he floor in front of the stall.]<br /><br />Amir: It just doesn't- I don't buy it man. I'm sorry, it doesn't make sense. Why would I- Why would I do this? Like, it doesn't- It doesn't help. You don't like me. It just drives you away even more, and then mumble in the bathroom?

[singing jingle again] Give me a break, man. Give me a break--<br /><br />Jake: I only have one bar left.<br /><br />Amir: Which means you've had three! So give me one! Give me one of your four bars. Just give me one of the four!<br /><br />Jake: Fine! Fine! Here. Take it.<br /><br />Amir: [taking bar] No thank you. You know what? On second thought, I don't really want it. I'm watching my weight -- watching it go up. [laughs] No, I'm going to toss it, though. [throws bar in trash can]<br /><br />Jake: Why did you do that?<br /><br />Amir: I had a second thought.<br /><br />Jake: So give it back to me!<br /><br />Amir: You already gave it up, okay? It was mine to throw away. I had a second thought; I didn't want it anymore; so I threw it away. What's it to ya?<br /><br />Jake: It was my candy bar.<br /><br />Amir: You gave it to me.<br /><br />Jake: You took it from me!<br /><br />Amir: I asked you for it and you gave it to me, so it was mine. I could have done whatever I want with it, alright? It's gone now. Forget it. Let it go. It's a sunk cost. Live life without the bar.<br /><br />Jake: Fine!<br /><br />Amir: [angrily yet quietly replying] Fine! Just, ughh... [talking to himself] So, if I eat it and two days later I take a crap and it goes in the toilet, he doesn't complain about that. But if I put it in the garbage now, then it's a bigger deal. I don't understand what the difference is. It's not his. It's gone. But he just latches on. He latches on and I can't let it get to me. I just have to let it go-- IT'S A FRICKIN' KIT KAT BAR, MAN! It's 99 cents! What do you want?! A quarter? You want a quarter for it, you're going to be that petty? Just forget it, man! Just pretend that I dropped it on the ground and I didn't want to eat it -- does that make you sleep at night?<br /><br />Jake: Why don't we just move on?<br /><br />Amir: Well, I'm not going to let you sit here and sulk about it, okay? Say something! You're obviously pissed!<br /><br />Jake: Yes, I am pissed! I said I just wish you didn't throw it away.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah? Well, sometimes wishes don't come true. I'm sorry.<br /><br />Jake: Whatever.<br /><br />Amir: I mean, when I was six I had a wish, too. I had a wish that everybody I knew would be dead. How's that for a wish?<br /><br />Jake: I don't know -- selfish?<br /><br />Amir: Bet you wish that one didn't come true.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah.<br /><br />Amir: You know, if you're gonna be a bitch about it, then here: [tossing Jake an unwrapped Kit Kat bar] A full Kit Kat bar. Enjoy that, ya bitch!<br /><br />Jake: So why'd you want one of mine?<br /><br />Amir: Okay, you know what? Here! [throwing more unwrapped Kit Kats at Jake] Take the whole lot! Jakey gets all the Kit Kats. Enjoy them, ya bitch!<br /><br />Jake: Why do you have these?<br /><br />Amir: Because I buy two or three a day and I save one, okay? But I bet you knew that already, didn't you, bitch?<br /><br />Jake: I clearly didn't.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, you know what? Here's an idea: We go bar for bar -- see who can eat the most candy.<br /><br />Jake: You just said you were watching your weight.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! Watching it go up!<br /><br />Jake: So, that wasn't even a joke?<br /><br />Amir: [with mouth crammed full of multiple Kit Kat bars] Are we doing this contest, or not?!<br /><br />[END]<br /><br />",

Well, I'm not laughing!<br /><br />JAKE: So they asked for your permission. <br /><br />AMIR: (through laughter: \"Asked for my!\") They gave me final cut approval, okay? Three weeks ago they send me a rough and it just sat in my inbox. Yesterday, on a whim, I reply \"I have no notes\". I don't know what got into me; it just happened. Ninety minutes later they send me a final cut; I guess they made some last minute audio tweaks. I respond, sight unseen, \"This is f***ing gold, I'm proud to know you guys. Love, Amir\", and then, this thing!<br /><br />JAKE: So this sounds like it's mostly your fault.<br /><br />AMIR: Lemme just-- lemme see if I can ask them to take it down or something. <br /><br />(Amir gets up and walks a few feet over to where the guys from Auto Tune the News (brothers Evan, Andrew, and Michael Gregory) are standing.

I dunno, I feel bad.<br /><br />ANDREW: We told you from the get-go, you've got total veto power.<br /><br />AMIR: That's true. I dunno, it is catchy.<br /><br />EVAN: Well, why don't you go take it down yourself? We made you an admin on the page.<br /><br />AMIR: Shut up okay! Maybe-- Let's just keep it up at this point.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, before you turn around and tell me that they can't delete the video, just know that I heard that entire--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah it's a no-go on the vid going down, man, I'm sorry, I talked to them but they won't budge.

I get runner-up, second-best joke of lunch with the too slow thing, looks like I'm too school for school (laughs); sorry just kidding, too COOL for school, not a mess-up because I caught it first.

That was funny! YOUR joke was weird!<br /><br />SARAH: Anyway, Amir, Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, this website, and he recently got arrested for sexual assault on a Swedish warrant, so. It's kinda like an international--<br /><br />(Jake comes back to the table.)<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot all my food, but if you guys are still talking about Julian Assange, he's the frickin founder of Wikileaks!<br /><br />AMIR: What's Wikileaks?<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta learn how to be funny, man. I'll tell you.. I'll tell you exactly what Wikileaks is, right now, if you can catch my low five.<br /><br />(Jake offers out his hand like before, and Amir slaps it before Jake retracts his hand.)<br /><br />JAKE: Too slow!<br /><br />AMIR: I touched it!<br /><br />JAKE: Ya knicked it!<br /><br />AMIR: I slapped it!--<br /><br />JAKE: (desperate) You KNICKED it!<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

For what?. Can I ask you a question, why do you never believe in me?<br /><br />JAKE: Focus. Alright this is the last thing I'll say, and it's not directly related to this specific thread, but you gotta change your email signature, man.<br /><br />AMIR: Why?<br /><br />JAKE: (The camera shows a shot of Amir's signature, which is ASCII art of a naked woman posing on her knees, with Amir written underneath.) It's porn.<br /><br />AMIR: It's art!<br /><br />JAKE: Barely.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright want me to teach you? The trick is to do Shift-2 when you want to draw a pussy. Now, let's talk about that fanzine for a sec. I'm gonna lobby you some ideas and you say Yes! if they're good, Totally!, if they're bad, and I love it! if you love it.<br /><br />JAKE: Ok so yes, totally, and I love it?<br /><br />AMIR: Yea.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, so it sounds like you're just trying to protect yourself against negative feedback.<br /><br />AMIR: Yea I don't like negativity.<br /><br />JAKE: Really? You could've fooled me, cuz you just sent this email, five seconds ago, while we were talking, and it's Darren's fiance with a skull and crossbones Photoshopped above her head, and it says Rest In Pieces.<br /><br />AMIR: (Agitated) Ok you gotta believe me, man.

You've destroyed my kitchen.<br /><br />Amir: I got angry, okay, I lost it for half a second, but! it'll all be worth it when that hundo-layer veg las comes out of the oven.<br /><br />Jake: I thought you said you didn't make it.<br /><br />Amir: You're right. Damn it, you're right! I suck!<br /><br />Jake: Chill out, chill out, okay. You don't suck.<br /><br />Amir: I do, I messed everything up. And now the Thai food's here. And I don't even have money to pay for it.<br /><br />Jake: Why didn't you bring money?<br /><br />Amir: Because I didn't think to because I'm such an idiot! Because I'm such a loser!<br /><br />Jake: It's fine, chill out. I'll pay for it, you can owe me.<br /><br />Amir: That's even worse, okay! I don't even want to owe you anything!<br /><br />Jake: I was just saying it so you wouldn't feel like you were taking a handout.<br /><br />Amir: I appreciate that, but, y'know, I don't want to owe you anything, ever! Like I don't even want to pay you off eventually, at this point I'd rather open the door, take the Thai food, spin him around, kick him in the small of the back and lock him out!<br /><br />Jake: Okay just chill out, I'll pay for it, you don't owe me, it's fine.<br /><br />Amir (sending text): got this blond bimbo wrapped around--<br /><br />Jake: Got the Thai.<br /><br />Amir: Got the Thai, good.<br /><br />Jake: Did you mean to send me this text message? got this blond bimbo wrapped around my finger. another free dinner down the gizzard because I own house at fake crying?<br /><br />Amir: I've been thinking about it and I want to go Dutch on the Thai. <br /><br />You gotta spot me my half though man. You gotta go Double Dutch for me. Can you do that for me bimbo?<br /><br />",

Not when people threw coins at you on the subway? Or when Ricky called you into his office and said you have to take this job more seriously? How about when you spent 45 minutes outside in the snow because the secruity guard wouldn't let you into our building -- how did you feel then?<br /><br />Amir: [pantomiming crying]<br /><br />Jake: See, that's good. You don't say anything.<br /><br />Amir: [pantomiming climbing up a ladder with ease] Not saying anything...<br /><br />Jake: Exactly.<br /><br />Amir: [pantomiming being trapped behind a wall again] Zero.

You're talking right now.<br /><br />Amir: Well, that's because you're not giving me any feedback!<br /><br />Jake: I was giving you feedback. Just shhh.<br /><br />Amir: [pantomiming being trapped behind a wall again] <br /><br />Jake: That's good...<br /><br />Amir: You're not just saying that?<br /><br />Jake: No. Just be quiet...<br /><br />Amir: You really mean that?<br /><br />Jake: [exploding] You know what?! Alright, you really suck at this! Why don't you just go wash the face paint off!<br /><br />Amir: It's called spray paint.<br /><br />Jake: Wow. You shouldn't have spray painted your face -- how did you do your lips?<br /><br />Amir: Like Binaca, okay? You form a wall with your tongue and go [pantomiming spraying at his open mouth) khh, khh, khh, and hope for the best.<br /><br />Jake: Oh my God...<br /><br />Amir: Hey, does everything taste like lead to you, or is that just a mime thing?<br /><br />[END] <br /><br />",

What the heck man? What if that was real?<br /><br />Jake: I could see you hiding under your desk. There were a lot of typos in there by the way<br /><br />Amir: Okay, you try finding every letter.<br /><br />Jake: You couldn't find an N or an O?<br /><br />Amir: I was limited. All right. I had one \"Guns and Ammo\" mag and that's it.<br /><br />Jake: There's no E in your by the way.<br /><br />Amir: There's no E in team either, bro.<br /><br />Jake: You're mixing up that metaphor. Why do you have a \"Guns and Ammo\" magazine?<br /><br />Amir: It came free with my gun, [He pulls out his gun and pulls the slide back] and my ammo! Ha ha! No, but just the gun though.<br /><br />Jake: Is that real?<br /><br />Amir: No! I paid 23 hundred dollars for a fake Kimber stainless Raptor 2. [Pulls the slide back again] Ha ha. It's very real. [Points the gun at Jake]<br /><br />Jake: That makes me real nervous man.<br /><br />Amir: [Still pointing the gun] Yeah, I would be nervous too. All right. A .45 caliber, 5 inch, match grade steel barrel hand fitted by Kimber himself, pointed straight at my gut hole!<br /><br />Jake: I don't have a gut hole.<br /><br />Amir: Well this'll make one brotha! Say goodnight! Pfffff! [Pretending to shoot the Jake]<br /><br />Jake: Easy! Don't point that thing at me!<br /><br />Amir: You easy okay! There's no bullets in this thing idiot!<br /><br />Jake: Please put that down.<br /><br />Amir: Do you trust me?<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Do you trust me?<br /><br />Jake: NO.<br /><br />Amir: [Pulling the slide and pointing the gun at his head] Then I'm gonna pull the trigger.<br /><br />Jake: Okay I trust you all right.

Yes.<br /><br />Amir: Why are you nervous if you trust me?<br /><br />Jake: I don't know okay!<br /><br />Amir: Then you don't trust me and I'm gonna pull it! In 3...2...<br /><br />Jake: Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! I do trust you, all right?<br /><br />Amir: Then if you do trust me, pull it yourself.

Pull it!<br /><br />Jake: I can't!<br /><br />Amir: You can!<br /><br />Jake: I can't dude!<br /><br />Amir: Ay look! Look at me! I'm telling you, there's no bullets. Pull the trigger!<br /><br />[Jake breathing heavy for a few seconds. Cut away to Pat listening to music having no idea what is going on. Jake breathes heavy again]<br /><br />Amir: You pussy!<br /><br />Jake: I can't do it! [Letting go of the gun]<br /><br />Amir: Then I'll do it!<br /><br />[Before Amir puts the gun to his head, Jake shoves Amir's hand upward just as a bullet shoots out into the ceiling]<br /><br />Amir: There was one bullet in it okay.

Let me leave you the best one-<br /><br />Jake: Take them all! Alright?  Take 'em all.<br /><br />Amir: Mhm.  Customer is always right.  And in this case, (In Jake's face again) you're the customer!<br /><br />Jake: You have to stop talking so close to my face alright?  You smell like absolute shit.<br /><br />Amir: You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I smell like doo-doo.<br /><br />Jake: What did you eat by the way?<br /><br />Amir: I had a very very very old radish and a little dollop of mayo and I just let that sit in my mouth overnight, so...<br /><br />",

You know right now you can walk into a Japanese grocery store in downtown Tokyo and buy a cube of watermelon. And I'm not talking about like a cubic watermelon, I'm talking about a legit cube of watermelon. Do you have any idea how unnatural that is?<br /><br />JAKE: You do know that's not a riddle right?<br /><br />AMIR: No, did you know that right now there's a group of scientists at Monsanto on a lunch break, at a Chipotle for all I care, and when they get back, they're gonna be working on a tomato that's genetically altered to be the size of an apple.<br /><br />JAKE: Tomatoes are the size of apples.<br /><br />AMIR: NOT cherry tomatoes! And not pizza.<br /><br />JAKE: You're not smart, man, alright...<br /><br />AMIR: Did you know that tomato paste isn't a glue substitute? Like, you can't use it to glue stuff.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, well right now my dad is getting a birthday card that's drenched, unreadable and disgusting.<br /><br />JAKE: That one just sounds like you had a bad arts and crafts accident, alright. Why did you have to glue his card shut in the first place?<br /><br />AMIR: Turns out I didn't! Thank you very much, meat eater! Ohhhh!<br /><br />JAKE: You eat meat! Ok you eat chicken McNuggets constantly--<br /><br />AMIR: No no no not in a while.<br /><br />JAKE: You're eating one right now.<br /><br />AMIR: (taking a nugget out of his mouth) Ok, one.

Laundry day ha...(Moves on to cat) Man, I remember when I first picked up the cat from the cat store...<br /><br />AMIR: What do you mean \"nothing else to wear\"?  You're already wearing something else; you're wearing the vest over that.  So it's like you're wearing a shirt jeans, that's a thing.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, well, it's a joke.  The vest is a funny joke.<br /><br />AMIR: On you?  Like is that a joke on yourself—<br /><br />JAKE: I don't care what I look like!  I don't give a crud what I wear.<br /><br />AMIR: So why're you-why is that top button unbuttoned?

(Rotates wrist to show Amir)<br /><br />AMIR: Why...all the effort?  Why're you wearing a leather band?<br /><br />JAKE: (Sarcasm) Oh my god it's so hard to put a band around your wrist and snap it in.  (Demonstrate)<br /><br />AMIR: I'm saying, like, goin' to the mall, that's like a lot of effort.  <br /><br />JAKE: (Sarcasm) Lots of effort to take a quick bus ride over the GW bridge and you thumb it down  to an Abercromie.  What's hard about that?  And guess what, I didn't pay a friggin' dime 'cause I ganked it!  Ah ha.  (Jake gets a phone call) (Suddenly upset) Oh, one second.

No, I- uh- nurse. (chuckling) I'm sorry, I went to medical school. Alright, I get paid the big bucks to make the boo-boos go away. So, (chuckles). Talk back again and we'll make it 40 CC's. Alright, make that 60. Great. Alright, 80 CC's, keep talking. Thank you. Alright, bye, 100 CC's. (hangs up)<br /><br />JAKE: Where did you get that beeper?<br /><br />AMIR: I didn't get it. Ok, I ganked it. <br /><br />JAKE: That's still getting it.<br /><br />AMIR: Why, where did you gank yours? Radio shack? You know I'm surprised that you can even talk to me right now with Steve Jobs' balls in your mouth.<br /><br />JAKE: You're being really crass today. How did you get a beeper from a doctor's office?   <br /><br />AMIR: Bachelor party last weekend. Yeah, my friend from high school, Marty's getting married so you know I came to play. (laughs) First step is a nice, little brunch with his family and I'm already a little buzzed after three Four Lokos and a shot of schnapps, some bozo jokingly dares me to bite into a glass of orange juice. (laughs) Before he even gets to the just kidding I am tooth-deep in the thing. I'm not an idiot, okay, so I think the thing's gonna crack but my eyes widen with fear when the bitch explodes in my mouth. I'm talking razor-sharp glass shards just cutting my mouth up from uvula to incisor, there was blood everywhere. Alright, next thing I know I'm in the back of Donnie's Camaro, he's the best man, and people are just begging me not to fall asleep. I'm laughing maniacally, my face is like a blood-sprinkler, the red liquid's just shooting everywhere, getting on the interior and stuff. To make matters worse I wasn't even invited to the frickin' thing. So I start passing out, you know, Nature's Promise and all.<br /><br />JAKE: That's a butter company.<br /><br />AMIR: I wake up in post-op four hours later and I needed 31 stitches to close me shut, nurse is livid, just crying in the corner because I've been shitting myself nonstop which sounds standard, but it's not.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound standard.<br /><br />AMIR: They choose this golden moment to give me a hospital bill. Uh-oh, daddy doesn't have health insurance. So I book it, alright. Cut to interior, hospital, day, later, I am barreling skull-first into a doctor, right into his chest, and he gets plowed to the floor. Medical equipment everywhere, alright. The beeper falls onto the ground and I just jump on it like a Nazi taking a grenade for his German cohorts. He looks passed out, but I'm not gonna take that risk, okay, so I shove the beeper three inches into my butt and I just take off in a dead sprint due north, remember that direction 'cause it's gonna come in handy later. I'm three towns over before I even realize nobody's chasing me and at that point I'm thanking God because my groin is torn to shreds.<br /><br />JAKE: So that beeper was in your butt?<br /><br />AMIR: For 14 miles. And the bitch still works. (winks)<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

So--<br /><br />JAKE: I specifically told you not to have anybody make a map. I said it would be too expensive.<br /><br />AMIR: You think this is too expensive? What do you think about those twelve bean bags, huh, man? You think those were cheap?<br /><br />JAKE: And those fourteen water coolers I passed in the kitchen?<br /><br />AMIR: Eighteen.<br /><br />JAKE: Those were also yours?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's to encourage discourse, communication, right?

A soothsayer, right over there?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, so he's just going to come up clouded in smoke and we're all just going to emerge next to him, chanting, being all sort of- our psyches mingling.<br /><br />JAKE: That's going to happen every hour?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. At eighty past the hour, of course.<br /><br />JAKE: That sounds like that might be a little too much. <br /><br />AMIR: Are you sure?

Elevators, man, right? (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: I told you not to talk to me for the rest of the day.<br /><br />AMIR: I was just in an elevator, ok, and nobody was looking at anyone. It was really uncomfortable!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you still do that thing where you enter the elevator backwards?--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! You know, so I'm facing the RIGHT way in case of emergency; it's just a safety precaution.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright well people don't wanna look at each other in elevators; it's sort of uncomfortable.<br /><br />AMIR: So I try to break the silence; you know, add a little warmth and comradery to this otherwise awkward elevator ride. You n- wanna know what I said?<br /><br />JAKE: Something about the weather?<br /><br />AMIR: No, that's boring. Ok I wanted to do something that they would REMEMBER me by. So I asked them, straight up, if you had to choose, which one would you rather have: eight legs, or two really long, eight-foot arms.<br /><br />JAKE: (gesturing out noodley arms) Like, telescopic, noodley arms?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, just like giant noodles for arms.<br /><br />JAKE: Giant noodle arms.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Or what was the other one?

Which one would you rather have?<br /><br />JAKE: Look, I said it was a stupid question, not in intelligent question; you're taking what I'm saying and turning it around--<br /><br />AMIR: Eight legs. Hm. I knew you'd take their side.<br /><br />JAKE: (sighs.) How was the reaction?<br /><br />AMIR: Muted. Mm-hmm.

Well, now I do.<br /><br />(Jake smiles gestures with his hand as if saying what are you talking about?)<br /><br />AMIR: What is with elevators, ok why is it so uncomfortable in there? Why is nobody allowed to talk to anybody? (in a stand up comedy cadence) What is it, like a library in there? I'm gonna check out a book, in an elevator?<br /><br />JAKE: You trying to do a stand up act, or something?<br /><br />AMIR: (to the camera) HOW can we break the ice.. in elevators, ok?

I want dis.<br /><br />Jake: That's the only thing I understand.<br /><br />Amir: Ok! If you don't want to make the donation just put in like $150 and then click send.

Somebody's being a bitch.

What?<br /><br />Jake: a lot of people have been complaining to me. <br /><br />Amir: And you believe them?! <br /><br />Jake: I haven't said what it is yet. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, I set up a spy cam in the women's restroom. Sue me. <br /><br />Jake: Wow. They might. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, then I'll countersue. How's that? Two sues for the price of one. <br /><br />Jake: It's about your stench. <br /><br />Amir: Or lack thereof. laugh<br /><br />Jake: No, not a lack thereof, exactly what I said. Okay? You reek of shit. <br /><br />Amir: Jealous much? <br /><br />Jake: I'm not jealous. Look, this isn't going away, alright? You smell like you're dead. <br /><br />Amir: I'll apologize, but I'm not gonna shower. <br /><br />Jake: That's not good enough, then. We all want the exact opposite. <br /><br />Amir: I said I was sorry! <br /><br />Jake: First of all you didn't, second of all we don't want your apology, we want you to take a shower. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, this is catching me way off guard. <br /><br />Jake: Is it really? Because last week a bunch of people chased you with a hose and soap. <br /><br />Amir: I thought that was a goof! <br /><br />Jake: Why would that be a goof? You whispered something to Sarah and she got an ear infection. <br /><br />Amir: Alright, you think I give a flaming fart what people say, man? <br /><br />(Amir pulls his legs up and grabs a lighter)<br /><br />Jake: I know you don't. Don't do that. <br /><br />(Amir lights a flame, starts to fart, and leak shit through his khakis as he moans)<br /><br />Amir: Oh, no! Oh, anyhoot! <br /><br />Jake: No! No! Not anyhoot, okay? You have to go change your pants now. <br /><br />Amir: Why, 'cause I farted? Wow. It was a toot. An SBD, so NBD, on NBC (to the NBC chime) laughs <br /><br />Jake: You leaked shit into your khakis. <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, ever heard of I'll clean it after work? So shut up. <br /><br />Jake: No. I haven't ever heard of (starts yelling) sharting your pants, with wet diarrhea, and then waiting a full five hours to clean it up, okay? That is the first time I've ever heard of that. <br /><br />Amir: Losers wipe, okay? Winners go home and f*** the prom queen. <br /><br />Jake: You're not gonna f*** anybody. It looks like you sat on a water balloon filled with chili. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, you think I give a flaming fart- <br /><br />(Amir kicks up his legs again) <br /><br />Jake: Oh my god, it smells like gasoline and fish. <br /><br />",

Hey can you do me a favour and read this e-mail from my dad and tell me if there's one thing that you can think of that he doesn't call me out on.<br /><br />Jake: Wow, long e-mail.

[put hands together and bows]<br /><br />J: That's really offensive.<br /><br />A: I just really needed to get out of the house, so I appreciate it.<br /><br />J: Okay, well I'm still pretty pissed at you about last night.<br /><br />A: [confused] ...Is this like an inside joke based on something that happened, because I'm sorry, I was a little bit gone.<br /><br />J: You were ENTIRELY gone, okay? You showed up three hours late and you were begging to the point of tears to change the locashe.<br /><br />A: Yeah, I say a LOT of funny things. <br /><br />J: It wasn't funny. You openly wept for a venue change for my friend's birthday party at her apartment to a quote college dive around the corner from this shithole.<br /><br />A: I thought the party needed a new energy, okay?! [starts waving his hands and dancing] Sometimes nights are about what kind of energy you're able to infuse -<br /><br />J: [interrupting] Right, no, no, no, I get that, but the party had a fine energy, right? They were lighting the birthday candles and then you blew them all out and you said Happy birthday to pee! and then you whipped out your penis and tried to urinate on the cake - but couldn't -<br /><br />A: [interrupting, irritated/defensive] I had just drained the main vein...like 25 seconds earlier.<br /><br />J: Okay, I'm not upset that you couldn't pee, I'm upset that you tried. Then you ran outside and a few of us followed you because you yelled I'm gonna go outside and legit hurt myself to teach you all a fucking lesson.<br /><br />A: A lot of the girls last night were slumpbusters, can we talk about THAT for a second?<br /><br />J: Not right now, okay? Once we were outside you asked my friend if she dared you to headbutt the windshield of a car until it broke. When she said no, you took off in a dead sprint and said You owe me five bucks, you sasquatch! and then you lowered your head and ran full speed into the bumper of a truck.<br /><br />[one cut during Jake's speech of Amir bobbing his head]<br /><br />A: That reminds me; that slumpbusting sasquatch owes me a five-spot. An Abe Lincolner.<br /><br />J: We heard a DEAFENING crack - like a log being broken over a rock - and you fell completely motionless to the ground. We thought you had broke your neck.<br /><br />A: [trying to imitate Mike Posner] You probably think, you think you're cooler than me.<br /><br />[Jake glares at Amir, who blinks slowly]<br /><br />J: ...your legs didn't work anymore after that, so you started scooting down the street on your butt, screaming I'm Lieutenant Dan! See if you can keep up with me, ya GUMPS!, but you were moving like, 2 inches every minute.<br /><br />A: [shaking his head] ...no...<br /><br />J: Yes, okay?! Is this the first time you're getting a little embarrassed?<br /><br />[cut to Amir still shaking his head, then back to Jake]<br /><br />J: Okay, I'm gonna keep on going...Okay, you whipped out your penis ONE more time; you said, follow my trail of pee to victory, but once again, you could not produce any urine - <br /><br />A: [angry] I HAD JUST DRAINED - <br /><br />J: [interrupting] The main vein. No, I remember that. Do you remember the skateboarder that rode by? He saw your penis and laughed at you?<br /><br />A: [squints and scratches his chin, then looks at Jake] ...Vaguely?<br /><br />J: You started crying? You said, Let's see your guido dick! I have a big penis and you have a string beanis!<br /><br />A: [rubbing his fingers on his temple] I'm sorry, is there a point to this story?<br /><br />J: You asked me why I was mad.<br /><br />A: [angry] Why don't you ask me why I'M mad, okay?! You take me to a slumpbuster festival, I haven't gotten any in like weeks - I'm on a 2-month dry spell - and EVERYBODY is outta my league.<br /><br />J: [confused] You just said it was a slumpbuster festival, now they're out of your league?<br /><br />A: THEY'RE BOTH, OKAY. I'm a 1, and they're 3s!!<br /><br />J: Just stop for one second and listen to me.<br /><br />A: [leans back, fumbling, unbuckles his belt and pants] No, you stop and listen to PEE.<br /><br />[Amir attempts to pee, Jake starts to look away, but looks back]<br /><br />J: ...Nothing.<br /><br />A: [leans forward] I just drained the main vein like a DAY ago.

Okay, here's a tip, don't take up any hobbies until you've learned how to wash yourself. <br /><br />Amir: Alright, you're not getting a Mason jar. <br /><br />Jake: You need a coal burning oven, by the way. If you want to blow you own glass you need to buy a coal burning oven. <br /><br />Amir: Alright, how 'bout this. You give me the 1875 or I blackmail ya. <br /><br />Jake: With what? <br /><br />Amir: With what, Isn't blackmail alone bad enough? Now you want to know with what? How about I punch ya, man.

I believe I'm going to have to pass on that glass studio. Yes, I'm going to have to pass on that glass, as they say. Laughs Yeah, my associate actually informs me that you need a coal burning oven which, you didn't quite tell me about, Mickey. You misled me Mickey, and I'm a little offended. Let me tell you something about myself, my friend: I do not cut corners. This is how I do it, yes on the glass studio, throw in an oven. Okay, if I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this, then I can't start cutting corners on an oven Mickey. laughs The cheque? The cheque- I just handed the cheque off to the postman right now.

The trick for guys is just to never wear any makeup. <br /><br />Amir (closing his compact): Alright, lemme tell you a story. In sixth grade, I was bullied so hard that my dad almost moved. Instead, my teacher called a parental mediation session. So it was just me and my dad, the tormenter and the tormenter's foster mom. They all ganged up on me so hard, that my dad moved. <br /><br />Jake: Sorry, your dad ganged up on you so hard that he moved? <br /><br />Amir (powdering his face): Yes. <br /><br />Jake: How does this relate to oily skin? <br /><br />Amir: It doesn't relate to oily skin. Okay? I just wear makeup, alright? Maybe you should care about your personal appearance too. You might look a little better. <br /><br />Jake: Stand up! <br /><br />(Amir stands up) <br /><br />Jake: Turn around! <br /><br />(Amir turns around) <br /><br />Jake: Great! I just wanted to make sure I was getting fashion advice from the guy who shit his pants three weeks ago and has yet to clean them. <br /><br />Amir: Ooh! Easy fix! (powders his butt) <br /><br />Jake: That's not- No! That doesn't fix it. <br /><br />Amir: Says the guy who got his pubes waxed everyday for like a month. <br /><br />Jake: I didn't do that. <br /><br />Amir: I'm talking about me. And you know what?

Something's acting whack.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine, but only because it sounds like it might be related to your job.  (Gets up and walks to Amir's desk) (Check's Amir's computer) Okay, it's not.<br /><br />AMIR: W-w-w-wait!<br /><br />JAKE: What is this?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, so basically the crux of this shot is that my—that's my boy, Bradlyn, in that tree and he's just hurling hard, hard rocks and like apples down at cars that drive by.  <br /><br />JAKE: Geez...<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, this video is—haha right there (points at computer screen)—this video is really polarizing on Youtube.  I loved it, but everyone else really, really hated it.<br /><br />JAKE: Then it wasn't polarizing.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, if you like that video, you're gonna love the next one.<br /><br />JAKE: I hated that video.<br /><br />AMIR: (Shouting) Well then you're gonna love the next one! <br /><br />JAKE: Shhhh!  Calm down, okay?  You're yelling. <br /><br />AMIR: (Nervously shouting) It's called Inversed Snot Rocket, okay? <br /><br />JAKE: I can see the title, alright?  Just shh—<br /><br />AMIR: (Yelling) Basically the crux of the short is that—<br /><br />JAKE: I'm gonna go because you're screaming—<br /><br />AMIR: (Grabs Jake by his shirt) NO!<br /><br />JAKE: Ah, ow!<br /><br />AMIR: (Yelling) You don't go!<br /><br />JAKE: Amir, Amir, you're hurting me.<br /><br />AMIR: (Yelling) I'm just excited to tell you <br /><br />JAKE: You're hurting me.<br /><br />AMIR: (Still yelling) the crux of the short, that's it!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, just let go of me, okay?!  (Pulls away from Amir's grip)  God, you're sweating so much right now!<br /><br />AMIR: (Still yelling) Okay, it's basically w-at the basic level of it it's just two people putting the spray paint bottle in the not—the the things are going up my nostrils and out of my mouth like and inverse snot rocket. <br /><br />JAKE: It's cool, shut up (puts hand on Amir's shoulder) you're starting to—<br /><br />AMIR: (Screaming) YOU DON'T TOUCH ME!

He builds this ramp at the edge of a drained lake—<br /><br />JAKE: Who names your friends?  Trayson?<br /><br />AMIR: (Yelling) Okay, we built this homemade catapult, right?  A twenty foot catapult and we put his grandma's chocolate lab in it and I'm holding   it down, but the hound just bites my neck, I shoo the mutt off the thing, but I'm holding the catapult with one hand and it just flies outta my hand clips my chin and it's lights out for me!  The-look at that, right there, (Points to computer) the top of my skull<br /><br />JAKE: Oh!<br /><br />AMIR: (Yelling) just hits the small of my back and I'm just like, \"haha haha haha ha\".<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, just stop yelling, you're sweating!<br /><br />AMIR: (Yelling) I'm excited to show this, okay?  More than just being excited, I'm excited to show this to—<br /><br />JAKE: (Grabs amir at the back of his head) Alright, hey, chill out, chill.  Who's gonna chill out?<br /><br />AMIR: (Struggling) Me.<br /><br />JAKE: Shut off your computer.<br /><br />(Amir makes a struggling noise)<br /><br />JAKE: Shut it off.<br /><br />(Amir closes his laptop)<br /><br />JAKE: Good boy.<br /><br />(Amir gasps for air)<br /><br />JAKE: Got to sleep.

      "script": "INTRO Jake - You're watching Jake and Amir!<br /><br />Amir - (baby talk) Yes you are! Yes you are!<br /><br />Jake - They're not babies. <br /><br />(Amir is going through the motions of applying the eyedrops but his glasses are still on)<br /><br />JAKE: Nope. You missed it. You hit your glasses again. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Hey, do you have someone you could set me up with, like on a date?<br /><br />JAKE: Um. I don't know, man. <br /><br />AMIR: Just. I'm lonely and horny, so. <br /><br />JAKE: OK, Definitely not. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, I've been on 5 dates in my life man. All right? The first one ended up insanely well but there's no way in hell she's ever going to go out with me again.  Two of the girls I gave pink eye to.  Fourth one, she ended up super, super pissed, but not at me. Fifth one, I really cannot for the life of me remember, oh right! No, you know what?  You killed her with a bus! <br /><br />JAKE: I di--I don't want to set you up with any of my friends, OK? Sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, are you afraid of me not being me on the date? Like me not being real, because I assure you, I will be there, it will be me, full throttle. Love me or hate me, you gotta love me. <br /><br />JAKE: All right.  I'm the girl.  Let's say we're on the date right now. Where have you taken me?<br /><br />AMIR: Here's something cute and quirky.  Let's order dessert first. Haha, that's weird, I'm different. <br /><br />JAKE: OK, you're trying too hard. Why don't you tell me about some of your hobbies. <br /><br />AMIE: All right, let's just be frank, all right? I want one thing, and one thing only. A one night stand. Only at the end of the night, we won't be standing. I want to lay down and hug you. <br /><br />JAKE: That's sad.  Tell me about where you grew up. <br /><br />AMIR: A lot of girls don't like guys that kiss and tell. Well, let me be frank with you, yet again, sweetheart. I never kiss, and always tell. (chuckles) I keep telling people how much I've never kissed. <br /><br />JAKE: Do you realize you haven't answered a single one of my questions?<br /><br />AMIR: And at the conclusion of the night, we walk home, I rub my hand against the dirty park bench, and just start rubbing your eyes.<br /><br />JAKE: So, the pink eye thing.  It's kind of a miracle the other 3 dates didn't get it.   <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well they probably did. <br /><br />JAKE: All right, well like I said, I don't know anyone who would want to go out with you. <br /><br />AMIR: Sorry. Is this still in character, like we're on the date?<br /><br />JAKE: No. <br /><br />AMIR: (getting worked up) What do you mean, no?<br /><br />JAKE: I mean, I don't want to do this anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: Is this why you invited me to this restaurant? To embarrass me in front of everyone? You slut!  <br /><br />JAKE: I don't want to play this game!<br /><br />AMIR: OK, this isn't a game, baby. This is me! All right, my heart is exposed right now and you can either tear it out, or s- or say yes and make me the happiest man ever.  <br /><br />JAKE: We're not really breaking up. <br /><br />AMIR: (sighs) Thank gosh, promise? (pause) I swear, all I want to do is lay down and hug.<br /><br />THE END.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtiWgvXLhE<br /><br />",

What are you even doing here?<br /><br />RICK: Well, you know I'm Amir's broker?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't know that; I thought you were his bookie.<br /><br />RICK: Well, bookies are for thugs. Brokers are for mugs! (He and Amir smile cheesily.)<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta stop it with the puns, I don't know who told you you were good--<br /><br />AMIR: Basically I give Rick money, you know, MY money, and he invests it in basketball games, baseball games,--<br /><br />RICK: Sports of that nature.<br /><br />JAKE: So it sounds like you're still a bookie.<br /><br />RICK: I also bought him a share of Dell.<br /><br />AMIR: Dude. I'm getting a share of Dell.<br /><br />JAKE: Just one share?<br /><br />RICK: Yeah, I woulda bought him more, but he just lost forty Gs on the 1982 Miss Universe Pageant.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeeah, Rick said that Miss East Germany was due, but uh, guess not. That was a big vig for the fantastic Mr. Fox--<br /><br />AMIR and RICK: eeheheh HENRY! HENRY! HENRY!--<br /><br />JAKE: Stop! Stop.<br /><br />(Rick's phone rings; the contact who is calling is Giant Egg, whose picture is of a fried egg. Rick looks at the phone, gets nervous, and hangs up the call, putting his phone down.)<br /><br />JAKE: I saw that.<br /><br />RICK: No you didn't.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, I did, it looked like you got a c--<br /><br />RICK: --Call from a giant egg? Impossible.<br /><br />JAKE: Then why are you being so defensive about it?<br /><br />RICK: Ok, look man. (covering the stack of egg cartons with she bloody-shouldered shirt from Zombie) I need you guys to do me an omelette-sized favor.<br /><br />AMIR: Anything!<br /><br />JAKE: ..No!..<br /><br />RICK: Look, in about thirty minutes, a slew of farmers and cops are gonna come in here, looking for me.<br /><br />JAKE: We said no.<br /><br />RICK: Well, they're gonna be talking all sorts of insane BS, about how I've stolen thousands of--<br /><br />JAKE: --Eggs?<br /><br />RICK: No. What?<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) What? I'm like..<br /><br />RICK: Tractors!<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) I dunno..<br /><br />RICK: You seriously have a sick obsession.<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) You're like- What is wrong with you, man?<br /><br />RICK: Was your mom a.. a chicken or something?<br /><br />AMIR: Were you frickin' laid, man? Were you frickin like hatched, bro?<br /><br />JAKE: HE'S the one that comes in here cracking eggs-- you know what, never mind.<br /><br />RICK: Anyway, look. I need you guys.. to say that I was never here.<br /><br />JAKE: Absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: (looks to where Rick was sitting, sees nothing, then holds up an egg) He's gone!<br /><br />JAKE: He's not gone. He walked like two feet; he's behind that plant.<br /><br />(The camera pans to show Rick standing behind the plant, clearly visible.)<br /><br />JAKE: (to Rick) You know you're not doing that good a job of hiding.<br /><br />(Rick puts a finger to his mouth to say shh, then opens his lips and pushes out an egg with his tongue, pointing his finger at Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: At least move behind the main branch!<br /><br />(Rick looks over at the main branch, then shakes his head no in response to Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: (throwing his arms up) Okay.<br /><br />AMIR: He's fine!<br /><br />JAKE: He's not fine!<br /><br />RICK: (in a hushed tone) I'm fine!

You sign every single post Amir Valerie Blumenfeld. <br /><br />AMIR: My blog is a one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring dad around here. This ain't no place for dads. <br /><br />JAKE: Really bad slogan, dude. <br /><br />AMIR: That's why I barely even used it, dude. <br /><br />JAKE: It's everywhere on the front page.

OK? Guys can tell, trust me. <br /><br />JAKE: This one says put a (bleep) on it (bleep)(bleep)(bleep)(bleep)(bleep) until he bleeds.<br /><br />AMIR: Did you know that a praying mantis have one spouse, one spouse for their entire life. OK, we can learn a lot from that. <br /><br />JAKE: That's not true. <br /><br />AMIR: It's on the blog. <br /><br />JAKE: That doesn't make it a fact, man. I think you confuse them with penguins because right here you wrote, in all caps, penguins eat their husbands.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, how about this for a true fact--<br /><br />JAKE: If it's about praying mantises, I don't want to know. (pause) So it was.<br /><br />AMIR: (mockingly) So you were. <br /><br />JAKE: That's not what I said. If you're going to mock me, at least listen to what--<br /><br />AMIR: Praying mantises can screw for 9 hours straight, OK? It's the most tantric sex you could ever imagine and I'm just supposed to sit on my fat butt and not blog about that? Like, no, I can't, what are you tal--<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I'm also realizing that a lot of your tips of the day are really mean, the same thing, and not tips. Like this one says 'my blog is the one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring your dad around here. This ain't no place for dads.' <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's called reverse psychology, OK?

Just one suggestion, because right now I feel like it's coming--<br /><br />JAKE: It's delete the whole thing. <br /><br />AMIR: After that, all right? Next tip, OK, let's say--<br /><br />JAKE: I guess the slogan. OK? It's kind of redundant to say 'dont' bring your dad around here' and then also say 'this ain't no place for dads'.  <br /><br />AMIR: You just lost all your credibility like that. (attempts to snap)<br /><br />JAKE: Ooo, you can't snap. <br /><br />AMIR: No, but Widely agreed that that slogan was the smartest thing I ever came up with.<br /><br />JAKE: Who agreed with that?<br /><br />AMIR: My friend Widely.<br /><br />JAKE: Your friends have the stupidest names I've ever heard--<br /><br />AMIR: YEAH, well you look like a short-haired horse! <br /><br />(blackout)<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I was thinking more about your fashion blog, and maybe I could help you out by writing a column.  Maybe then people will go to it. It'll be like J-Witz talking about fedo-do's, leather bands, vests . . . <br /><br />AMIR: Nah, I'm OK.

It will cut through this carob. And if you don't believe me, let's do 'em both, at the same (cuts finger with knife) ti-ahh<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry, man, I wan't listening.<br /><br />AMIR: That's OK. (laughs) Did you see it cut the fig? And just slice through that carob?<br /><br />JAKE: I did hear you cut your finger. I told you to be careful.<br /><br />AMIR: You didn't? (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: I did, yes I did, I actually did.<br /><br />AMIR: (simultaneously) You didn't? (laughs) You didn't? But that's OK, because you know what, a good salesman powers through. How often do you cut a steak?<br /><br />JAKE: I just caught a glimpse of that cut, man, and that's really bad.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: The tip of your thumb is just dangling.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, now you know how sharp the paring knife is, right? (sucks cut) Hm, hmmm.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow, that's not good enough, O.K., you can't just lick it like you're eating barbecue ribs, you have to go to the E.R.<br /><br />AMIR: And you have to go to jail. O.K? Because these, these knives are a steal at any price.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, number one, why are you selling knives? O.K., you have a job, and number two, where did you get carobs and figs? And number three, you don't have a thumb. Go to the hospital.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't need a thumb, O.K., 'cause I got nine fingers left, nine reasons why these will be the last knives you ever have to buy.<br /><br />JAKE: Put pressure on the wound!<br /><br />AMIR: Mhmm, I am, I'm gonna put pressure on the yound to snatch these up A.S.A.P. because supplies are limited.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop flipping this around, O.K., you're losing a lot of blood.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well you're losing the deal of a lifetime. How's that for deadly?<br /><br />JAKE: O.K., how much- how much are the knives?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh these knives? Sorry, these are not for sale. I'd be crazy to sell these to you.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't try the stupid sales trick on me, O.K., I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll just go take care of yourself.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll take the money but you cannot get these knives. I'm sorry.<br /><br />JAKE: What is going on?<br /><br />AMIR: I spent a fricken g on these knives, like, an hour ago, I can't just give them to you.<br /><br />JAKE: You were just trying to sell them to me!<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm trying to sell you these carobs and figs, the softest fruit you'll ever see, but you were just obsessed with the knives so I thought I'd do that for a bit before veering the argument back to carobville. Unfortunately, I got a little sliced en route, so-<br /><br />JAKE: (on phone) Hi, 9-1-1? Yes, I need an ambulance.<br /><br />AMIR: (to phone) You need a fig.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, my coworker-<br /><br />AMIR: Best friend.<br /><br />JAKE: cut off his thumb. Amir, what blood type are you?<br /><br />AMIR: O-positive.

Let me ask you a question.  You on the good book?  The facebook?<br /><br />Jake:  Yeah<br /><br />Amir:  Yeah?  It's kinda like MySpace but for college kids, it's all interactive.<br /><br />Jake:  Right, that's not true, I said I was on it.<br /><br />Amir:  You don't think it's interactive?<br /><br />Jake:  Just, what's your point?<br /><br />Amir:  I'm saying these privacy settings they're completely wack.<br /><br />Jake:  Meaning?<br /><br />Amir:  Oh, come on, you gotta be pretty naïve to think Zark Fuckerberg isn't selling our shit to Skymall for kickbacks at this point.<br /><br />Jake:  Just type it all up in an email and send it to me.<br /><br />Amir:  Ok, no no.  Explain to me how my account gets hacked every day.<br /><br />Jake:  Sometimes I see your facebook password as you status message.<br /><br />Amir:  [exasperated]  Yeah, because I think I'm logged out but I'm not, ok!?  So I'm typing it in but it's my status!<br /><br />Jake:  Don't yell at me like that's not an answer to your question.<br /><br />Amir:  I'm just saying that some of these privacy settings are legit anus-infested, ok?  Everybody-Like every rando with a smartphone and an AOL account could just access my pics.<br /><br />Jake:  Your pics?  You have one facebook album titled 'Another Day at the Races' and there's only one photo in here and it appears to be you at a dog pound bottomless with peanut butter all over your flaccid penis, you're surrounded by ten puppies and each one of them is ignoring you. <br /><br />Amir:  I need to untag it.<br /><br />Jake:  You need to delete it from the internet entirely.  Ok, you're wearing a shirt that's like eight sizes too big and it reads 'don't be offended if you're a dog lover - so am I' and the caption of the photo is 'who wants to see me get my D wet' subcaption 'you're gay if you click this' subcaption 'delete' subcaption -<br /><br />Amir: [interrupts]  Subcaption!  Subcaption caption!<br /><br />Jake:  [annoyed] Don't make fun of me here, ok?!  You're the idiot.  Subcaption: your facebook password.<br /><br />Amir:  I thought I was logged the fuck out!<br /><br />Jake:  How about this?  Just calm down, let's calm down.  Look at the groups you're a member of.<br /><br />Amir:  I am calm.<br /><br />Jake:  'One million strong against the new facebook,'  '10 million strong against the facebook redesign,' '100 million to say that Facebook is spying on us,' 'Amir Blumenfelds of the world unite.'  This last one, 'If one billion people join this group I'll slam my nuts in the door.'  All of them you're the only member, and this last one you uploaded the video... [clicks] It's you slamming your nuts in the door!  Why would you do that before anybody joined?<br /><br />Amir:  Because I wanted to sweeten the deal!  Alright, I wanted to let people know what was in store for them if they signed up for the frickin' group!<br /><br />Jake:  So you actually just went and slammed your nuts in the door?!<br /><br />Amir:  Well, ah, ok, here's the thing.  I got amped up, right, I was trying to pump myself up to actually do the video one day and I said you know what, I'm ready, so I end up slamming my nuts in the door, and what am I gonna do?  Just sit on the video? No, I decided to upload it, and you know what?-<br /><br />Jake: [interrupts] It has three views!<br /><br />Amir:  Exactly!  And you know what?  Those three views they're probably all from a frickin' Skymall and Zark Fuckerberg he's walking around right now with massage boots over his head because it's a kickback from the frickin' mall!<br /><br />",

That's probably why I busted my shin dude.<br /><br />Amir: How does that have anything to do with your shin?<br /><br />Jake: I'm taking a minute off the final time I'm sorry.

No that's not right.<br /><br />Jake: I don't need math, dude. Not when I'm this athletic.

Why are you always writing in your notebook and never on your computer?<br /><br />AMIR: Can I ask you question? Stand up so I can see your jeans.<br /><br />JAKE: That's not a question. Let me see your notebook.  <br /><br />(Amir throws the notebook over Jake's head)<br /><br />JAKE: What are you doing?

You start every entry with 'dear diary'.<br /><br />AMIR: As a goof.<br /><br />JAKE: On who?? You wrote, 'dear diary, Jake hasn't complimented me in a million days' which sounds like an exaggeration because two days ago in a date marked October and 40th--<br /><br />AMIR: All Hallow's Eve. <br /><br />JAKE: Nope. You wrote, 'Jake complimented me today.' Which I actually don't remember. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! You were texting, OK? And someone said something that made you laugh, and you were smiling, and then you looked up at me and like, you know, once--<br /><br />JAKE: (reading) 'once our eyes met, his smiled turned instantly into a scowl, but for that moment, he was all smiles and it was like a--<br /><br />AMIR and JAKE: Dream'.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, exactly.<br /><br />JAKE: You count that as a compliment?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! That's a win! OK, I count that as a 'W' in the old diary.<br /><br />JAKE: I thought it was a journal. <br /><br />AMIR: That's a journal. (holding up a scroll) This is a diary. <br /><br />JAKE: That's a scroll. Let me see your backpack. <br /><br />(Amir tosses Jake his backpack)<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah. This is just filled with notebooks and scrolls. <br /><br />AMIR: Dinner tonight?<br /><br />JAKE: Wow, please don't start saying that again. <br /><br />AMIR: I barely say it anymore!<br /><br />JAKE: You used to say it all the time. <br /><br />AMIR: Exactly, and that's why it's funny to do that. <br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: You say stuff over and over, OK? That's what makes it funny.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah but it gets old and repetitive. <br /><br />AMIR: No, no-<br /><br />JAKE: You have to change it up a little.<br /><br />AMIR: No, no! In a perfect world, everything would always stay the same. OK, nothing would ever change, you know that. <br /><br />JAKE: Wow, yeah, you wrote that in your diary. <br /><br />AMIR: Journal. <br /><br />JAKE: No!

Got me once in the neck, twice in the forearm, and then like two more times in the abdomen.<br /><br />Jake: So not right in the jugular, right? Why were you fighting a snake?<br /><br />Amir: I didn't feed the prick for like, two weeks 'cause she was being a bitch. Then I decided to start taunting her, you know, dancing around with dead mice all over my body. Dumb ass went for it! And got it!<br /><br />Jake: Sounds like you're the prick and the bitch because you're starving a snake. You're also the dumbass because you're dancing around a hungry snake with mice all over your body.<br /><br />Amir: So you're saying I'm dumber than a snake?<br /><br />Jake: I wasn't saying that, but yeah, for the record I do think you're dumber than a snake.<br /><br />Amir: OK you should have been there man, Leron was dying!<br /><br />Jake: He was laughing at you?<br /><br />Amir: No he was legit dying, like he got bit by a snake last week but he was like too cool to go to the hospital....<br /><br />Jake: Was it a snake or your snake?<br /><br />Amir: It's my snake now because I liked her feistiness, OK? But it was a snake at the time. I thought I could tame the wild beast. Turns out.... I could!<br /><br />Jake: No it turns out you couldn't, cause remember it clipped you? This morning? Like six times?<br /><br />Amir: Mmhmm....<br /><br />Jake: OK you shouldn't own pets man, you can barely keep yourself alive.<br /><br />Amir: OK don't tell me I shouldn't own pets, I've had like, ten owls in the past year. <br /><br />Jake: What happened to them?<br /><br />Amir: They're frickin' dead!

We're gonna go... stag. (chuckles)<br /><br />Jake: Why the air quotes?<br /><br />Amir: That's when you go alone, without a date, but—<br /><br />Jake: I know what stag is; you did air quotes over my boys.<br /><br />Amir: 'Cause none of those douches ponied up the dough yet, all right? And they all said no to me. It's like, I'm doing all the leg work; the least they could do is not yell at me.<br /><br />Jake: Gotcha, so it sounds like you're going to prom completely alone.<br /><br />Amir: Nah, I'm gonna go with Mickey, my friend.

We'll skip it!] to go into the prom for, like, a little bit! [Jake: It—no, why?] We're gonna go [Jake: Why?] for half a second! [Jake: Why?

Speak of the devil! (talking on phone) Hey bitch! (chuckles) Hey, I hope you're not lactose intolerant—'cause you're getting milked tonight! (chuckles) Good! No, good, put him on.

No, I'm in the cool group, and we all agree that your daughter is a zero. She's less than a zero, and guess what? She's gonna wake up with cheese in her ears tomorrow morning, which ain't gonna help the situation. (chuckles) Y'know what, good, call the cops. I just won't show up then. (chuckles) Actually... can you not, because I wanted to show up and do the milk—well, I don't wanna get arrested! So now I can't go—I dropped a G on this frickin' tux, sir! This was supposed to be the most magical night of my life, and you're basically telling me not—that I can't go, because I'm—okay. Great. Bye. (hangs up) Yeah, my night just opened up hard, so we can hang out. I might wanna call in a bomb threat though, y'know; if the fuzz are gonna be there, we might as well frickin' make them earn their keep.<br /><br />Amir: (talking on phone) Ah, Mickey, my friend!

I don't c—I don't know, man; you spent two weeks on a dairy farm. (laughing) That's not my problem anymore! That's your milk, your problem, Mickey! The operash is a no-go like I said, Mickey.

Okay, I really wanna take a picture (simultaneously) then post it online, otherwise it doesn't exist. No, gimme!

Ow, ow, ow, Amir, listen- Fine, take it! God, what are you- (Amir throws phone into river)<br /><br />AMIR: Okay? Are you happy? Disconnect, bitch! Sign off. Get away from the grid. It's over. You are so mad because- Oh my- I'm taking a picture of that. I am (taking selfie) taking a picture, me and the grump. (laughs) Tweeting it, hashtag douche doesn't know how to disconnect.

[Unzips jacket again, only gets an enthusiastic response from Amir, rezips jacket looking disappointed.]<br /><br />MURPH: What?<br /><br />JAKE: I asked if he was okay. I said, \"is Pat okay?\" and then you guys stared at me like I was Great Caesar's ghost.<br /><br />DAVID: His brothers are at the hospital right now but uhm...<br /><br />JAKE: But uhm Busted Tees.<br /><br />DAVID: What?<br /><br />JAKE: I said it's great that his family is there. That's really important you know to be there for him but you can buy the funny shirt at Busted Tees and that's, we're done talking about it.  His life is hanging by a thread. Speaking of threads [unzips jacket again]<br /><br />AMIR: I will buy one.<br /><br />JAKE: That's one! Can I get another? Can I get another? To the highest bidder.<br /><br />AMIR: Me.<br /><br />JAKE: Not the time<br /><br />AMIR: Okay.<br /><br />JAKE: Not the time. Not right now.

I'm pissed! Some drunk driving f-wad killed our friend.  Is he gonna be fine or what?<br /><br />DAVID: He's not gonna be fine, but he's not dead. <br /><br />JAKE: If he's not dead then why are we stressed out, okay? <br /><br />AMIR: Thank you.<br /><br />DAVID: He may not walk again.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God then I have the perfect thing for him.  It's called a t-shirt and you don't need legs to wear one.  All you need to do is...<br /><br />AMIR: You gotta learn how to be funny<br /><br />JAKE: HAHA don't. All right? You're not exactly great at bringing street cred to things. <br /><br />DAVID: Okay, I think you should go home. Both of you should go home.<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, let's go, he's right<br /><br />JAKE: No trust me man, I'd love to go home. I would love to.

You stabbed me!<br /><br />AMIR: In the hand...<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah!<br /><br />(Jake is reading Amir's screenplay)<br /><br />AMIR: So?<br /><br />JAKE: So I read it.<br /><br />AMIR: Took you long enough.<br /><br />JAKE: It's over 400 pages.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, most of that is scene direction, though-<br /><br />JAKE: -Which makes it longer.<br /><br />AMIR: Enough talk. What'd you think?<br /><br />JAKE: Sounds like you still want to be talking then.<br /><br />AMIR: What did you think?<br /><br />JAKE: That you shouldn't write screenplays anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: Give me one thing, okay? Give me one thing to hone in on. It's so broad.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not going to give you one thing. You always want one thing.There are thousands of screenplay rules, right? And I can't imagine one of them that you didn't break.<br /><br />AMIR: Just try to focus all your energy, like a laser, on one thing, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop saying like you want one thing, like you only could've made one mistake. You made a lot of mistakes.<br /><br />AMIR: Focus it. Focus in on one.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, the first mistake you could've made: your title is F*ck It: I'm Going Fishing Instead.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow! Congrats, grad! You can read.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't get defensive so early, okay? I mean, I read the whole thing, didn't I? And page 96 to 311 is one long, unbroken run-on sentence about how your main character, Brake Obama - a name I assume you spelled incorrectly-<br /><br />AMIR: -Probably autocorrected...<br /><br />JAKE: I doubt it. About how Brake Obama either needs to show his birth certificate or resign as mayor.<br /><br />AMIR: That impostor is from Hawaii, I guarantee it.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, that's true.<br /><br />AMIR: Maybe you'll be singing a different tune when you realize who we were thinking of for the male lead.<br /><br />JAKE: Another thing: all of your scene headings say Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: Edward frickin' Nort.<br /><br />JAKE: Norton.<br /><br />AMIR: No, my cousin's lawyer, Edward Nort.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I don't even think you need an actor because there's only one line of dialogue. It comes on page 299, and I think it's a typo because the main character says, Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: You should've heard Mr. Nort deliver that line. He nailed it in callbacks.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, how about this: I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.<br /><br />AMIR: So basically, you're jealous 'cause we didn't cast you as the main guy.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, I'm not jealous, alright? I don't give a shit.<br /><br />AMIR: You're not annoyed we went with Nort over you?<br /><br />JAKE: I would've loved at least an opportunity to make callbacks, to know I was seriously considered.<br /><br />AMIR: You were seriously considered. You were!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, bullshit!<br /><br />AMIR: Yes!<br /><br />JAKE: You dragged my ass in there as a dog and pony show, alright? You had Nort and I from day one and you put in there to light a fire under Nort's agent's ass. Well guess what? (gets serious) Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck-<br /><br />AMIR: -Bad!<br /><br />JAKE: That was not bad! That was good! Nort's bad. Here we go, southern twang! (in southern accent) Interior-<br /><br />AMIR: -No.<br /><br />JAKE: I don't give a- Don't say No while I'm talking, okay? Let me finish! It's gonna sound bad if you say No while I'm trying to do it. Listen! (in southern accent) Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />",

Not buying that! Not buying that at all. That's a fake spin; you're just spinning to make it seem like you're choking because I told you to spin.<br /><br />[David comes in.]<br /><br />DAVID: Jake's choking!<br /><br />AMIR: No no, this is just a game we're playing, okay? And you're not invited. So leave.<br /><br />[As David leaves, Jake claws at the air in an attempt to get his attention.]<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry, it's just that if this isn't a goof, it should be me that saves you, not some... other loser, alright? Amir saves Jake. That's... that's the lead.<br /><br />[Jake falls out of his chair. He slumps to the floor and stops moving entirely. Amir just shakes his head. Then Amir slides Jake's sandwich toward himself.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna eat your sandwich... so if you're alive... better stop me...<br /><br />[Jake lies motionless on the floor. Amir begins eating his sandwich.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay... great acting job. The best Actor... -Grammy... goes to... you! [pause] You didn't laugh at any of my jokes... and now I'm not gonna save yours. [pause] Um... [pause] Ummm... [impersonating Trump] You're fired! [pause] Hm. Wow... you know, I gotta hand it to you, man... didn't think you'd take it this far! Hm. Aah!<br /><br />[Amir throws the bread from the sandwich at Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Now I wish you are alive, because if you're dead, people are gonna blame me... and you're gonna feel... like a pony. [pause] Okay! This has been a dope lunch, thank you, but I don't deserve this star-treatment. So.<br /><br />[Amir leaves Jake alone. Jake lies motionless on the floor. The only sounds are background noises of the office. Then Jake sits up.]<br /><br />JAKE: Come on, did that really not look real?<br /><br />END<br /><br />",

Are you guys laughing 'cause you're about to get fired?<br /><br />JAKE: Why would we be laughing if that were the case?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, why'd you cut out at 3:30 to go get ice cream?<br /><br />JAKE: There's an ice cream truck downstairs. We were gone for like, fifteen minutes.<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, actually, my dear Watson, it was twelve.<br /><br />JAKE: So it was less than I thought. It's the first nice day of the year and - No! No. I don't have to justify this to you.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you don't have to justify it to me. You do have to justify it to your boss, though. (points to his computer) Don't you?<br /><br />JAKE: (looking at Amir's computer) What are these?<br /><br />AMIR: Thirty three emails sent from your account to Ricky, your boss. Shame you weren't here to stop me. Oh wait, I forgot. You're in a corn maze!<br /><br />JAKE: You actually did forget; we were getting ice cream. (reading email) Dear Ricky, I don't value my job as much as I do that sweet, sweet cream.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, and then he responds as the Donald, Ya fired.<br /><br />JAKE: No, he didn't respond. You emailed him again, and you said, Do you want your letter of resignation in a waffle cone or a waffle bowl, sir? Or is it easier if I just blend it up in a soy vanilla frappuccino?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, cream on the side.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't write that.<br /><br />AMIR: And mixed in.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't write that.<br /><br />AMIR: I just thought of it two seconds ago. Otherwise I would've written it. But now, Ricky gets the hit and he's livid.<br /><br />JAKE: No, that's when you finally got his auto-response. He's on vacation for the week, and you responded to that, What a quinky-doink, I'm also on vacation as I've mentally checked the f*ck out twelve minutes ago and went deep in that cream, cream county, and you know what? It is sweet. It tastes like never working in this town again.<br /><br />AMIR: For a thousand Gs, I will un-send that email.<br /><br />JAKE: You can't do that. It looks like you started back-tracking anyways, 'cause this email reads: Sir, forgive me for getting ice cream, I value this job.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, keep reading. It gets brat-worse.<br /><br />JAKE: No, it doesn't, it looks like you come clean in the next email; you write, You've just been had, this was an Amir Blumenfeld prank-duction. You shoulda seen the look on your face.<br /><br />AMIR: You looked like a friggin dildo baggins!<br /><br />JAKE: You didn't write that.<br /><br />AMIR: I just thought of it! Everything that I'm saying now, I just thought of so it's not in the emails.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, well I'm just saying you didn't add it. Okay, well you went on; you said, Please, please, please open up Photobooth and take a picture of your mug right now and send it to me, and I wanna see what a legit dildo baggins you must look alike, sir.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, are we done here?<br /><br />JAKE: So it looks like you didn't just think of the dildo baggins-<br /><br />AMIR: (raising voice) Are we done here?<br /><br />JAKE: Where are you going?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm cutting out early, okay? It's the first nice day of the year, and you expect me to spend it indoors? No! I'm going home!<br /><br />JAKE: So it sounds like you're still going to be indoors.<br /><br />AMIR: (takes a bite of a co-worker's ice cream) Woo! Lactose intolerant since '94 baby!

I laughed my head off.<br /><br />AMIR: You're not running, you're--<br /><br />JAKE: I'm power-walking.  It's better for you.  Good for your core, and it burns more calories.  <br /><br />AMIR: More calories than running?<br /><br />JAKE: No, than sitting. <br /><br />AMIR: Check it.  Half the effort, twice the reward. <br /><br />JAKE: Looks like none of the effort, your legs are just split over the treadmill. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well according to this machine, I've already burned 310 calories, so...twinkie time! <br /><br />JAKE: That's a hotdog. <br /><br />AMIR: It's cream filled!<br /><br />JAKE: Twelve miles per hour, huh? Slow down! <br /><br />AMIR: I don't slow down, I speed up, and when I look at you, I throw up. <br /><br />(Amir throwing up)<br /><br />AMIR: That is a death machine, man. <br /><br />AMIR: What's your record for longest treadmill run?<br /><br />JAKE: It's only 2 miles, but I usually do other stuff for cardio like kickboxing or zumba. <br /><br />AMIR: Zumba?<br /><br />JAKE: Kickboxing, I said. (slaps Amir's chest) Ooo...nut shot!<br /><br />AMIR: Check it out. Walking backwards.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, well it's not that impressive because you're going really slow. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well I'll FALL IF IT GOES ANY FASTER!<br /><br />JAKE: Shhh! Shhh! (steps off his treadmill and over to Amir) You have to be quiet, OK?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm going to!<br /><br />JAKE: Shut up. Amir, I'm stopping the machine--<br /><br />AMIR: I'm goo--<br /><br />JAKE: I'm stopping the machine.<br /><br />AMIR: Want a sip?<br /><br />JAKE: Is that soda?<br /><br />AMIR: Better! It's an experimental energy drink that my cousin Leron is trying to copyright called 'lazer'.  It's like fifty hour energy, WOO!<br /><br />JAKE: What's in it? <br /><br />AMIR: He basically boils down like a case of soda pop down to its corn syrup, then he adds sugar in the raw--<br /><br />JAKE: No, thank you. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, well let me FINISH--with the ingredient list, sorry but you sound like the frickin' FDA.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I can tell you're not running.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, but can the ladies tell?<br /><br />JAKE: Yup. A girl just came over here and said that if you're not going to use the treadmill then she wants to get on. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, I'm sorry, but she was a fat bitch. <br /><br />AMIR: Then he takes candy corn and melts it down to the raw, and a bottle of Aunt Jemima's maple syrup and melts it down to the raw.  Then he takes one of those big lollipops, that you can only get at Disney Land and melts it down--<br /><br />JAKE: --to the raw.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! To the frickin' raw!<br /><br />AMIR: Here we go! Shoeless Joe Jackson!  Shoeless Joe Jackson back on the horse baby!<br /><br />(Amir throwing up again)<br /><br />AMIR: Two times, two times in one session! What are the odds?<br /><br />JAKE: Really high when you eat as many kielbasas as you do. <br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, but I've been told...<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta be quiet, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: You gotta be quiet and mighty old. Sound off.<br /><br />JAKE: Shh! Shh!<br /><br />AMIR: Sound off. <br /><br />JAKE: Shut up!<br /><br />AMIR: Sound off, shh, shh, SHUT UP! <br /><br />THE END. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjhzZz8X5g <br /><br />",

Who just called you?<br /><br />Amir: None of your bitchness.<br /><br />Jake: It actually is my bitchness because you're running a phone sex hotline at work—and now my phone's ringing. Did you post my number <br /><br />too?<br /><br />Amir: I don't think... no.<br /><br />Jake: Okay well it's coming from an area code that I don't recognize.<br /><br />Amir: 732?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah.<br /><br />Amir: Jersey. I mean, is it?<br /><br />Jake: Okay well, yeah, well I guess you spend a lot of time in New Jersey on the weekends.<br /><br />Amir: Sometimes I spend gas station time there, but like nothing more than that.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, well I'm going to know if you posted my number if I answer this and it's somebody that I don't know asking me what I'm <br /><br />wearing.<br /><br />Amir: Which is why I swear to god that I didn't leave your phone number.<br /><br />Jake: (Talking on the phone) Hello? (Hangs up) Yeah. That guy's jerking off.<br /><br />Amir: I left your phone number. I just remembered and I wanted to come clean because the idea of me not telling you was eating me up <br /><br />inside. I just thought you wanted some company while you were all up in my sand.<br /><br />Jake: That's not what you were saying before man.<br /><br />Amir: I forgot it for half a second but then I remembered it: my sa...<br /><br />Jake: It was snatch.<br /><br />Amir: Dammit, no. It wasn't that, but you get the prize for getting it the closest.<br /><br />Jake: That was it.<br /><br />Amir: No, that wasn't it. I already gave you the prize, stop lobbying for more. (Gets a call) Hello? Uh... I don't know why don't you <br /><br />ask Jake what it smells like, he's currently in it. (To Jake) He's asking me about my—<br /><br />Jake: Snatch.<br /><br />Amir: Snatch, yeah.<br /><br />Jake: Got it.<br /><br />",

What is a cock future?  <br /><br />So the government needed to raise the debt ceiling in order to pay back billions of dollars in foreign loans. (interrupted by Amir)  <br /><br />Amir: Woah woah slow down I wasn't listening.  <br /><br />Jake: Slow down or you weren't listening?<br /><br />Amir: What's the difference?<br /><br />Jake: Well one implies you were giving some effort but I was just talking too fast, the other one is just that you're being an asshole Interrupted by Amir  <br /><br />Amir: Woah woah slow down!  <br /><br />Jake: So it was the second one?  <br /><br />Amir: Second WHAT!  <br /><br />Jake: You then rolled up a hundred dollar bill, shoved it in Karens ear and lit the tip of it on fire, screaming Enjoy this ear candle you dumb bitch, it's half the price of a cock future and unlike you it's guaranteed to blow smoke up my ass. <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, which got a huge laugh.<br /><br />Jake: A lot of people tried to tackle you.  <br /><br />Amir: So why doesn't Obama just like cut a check and call it a day?  <br /><br />Jake: You think Obama would be the one to cut a check? Amir shrugs They needed more than a Trillion dollars.<br /><br />Amir: Oh a trillion. Which is?  <br /><br />Jake: A thousand billion<br /><br />Amir: Right. Which is?<br /><br />Jake: A thousand million, which is a thousand thousand, which is a thousand dollars, which is how much four chicken nuggets cost.  <br /><br />Amir: Got it. (Amir attempts to throw a chicken nugget into his mouth but misses)<br /><br />Jake: Where did you get that?<br /><br />(Amir making a weird face while Jake talks) Security came to escort you out; you got down on your hands and knees and begged Karen for just one of her cock futures, you said: I'm sure my dad would be disappointed to see me grovelling, but the look in his eyes when I show him I'm the certified owned of a cock future, would surely erase 28 years of disapproval.  <br /><br />Amir: I'm a coward and a fool! .. I feel like the word staunch was co opted by the right, I mean like you can be a staunch Republican, but you can't be a staunch Democrat? like who made those rules —  (Jake interrupts)  <br /><br />Jake: You can be a staunch Democrat — (Amir interrupts jake)<br /><br />Amir: I don't interrupt you, ok, I don't interrupt your stand ups so don't interrupt mine, sorry but..  <br /><br />Jake: You do interrupt me a lot, not necessarily during my stand up — (Amir interrupts)<br /><br />Amir: Name one time I interrupted you.  <br /><br />Jake: You're interrupting me right now —<br /><br />Amir: Name one time!<br /><br />Jake: It's happening right now — (AMIR interrupting: I defy YOU *), this is interruption!<br /><br />Amir: I feel like we don't need money if everyone just decided to use..(Jake interrupts)  <br /><br />Jake: I know, Chucky Cheese tokens instead of money, right, you said that maybe too much during the meeting.  <br /><br />Amir: [Tickles Jake] Are you ticklish?  <br /><br />Jake: Yes, I'm very ticklish but your hands are so cold, and wet and clammy that I'm just grossed out..<br /><br />You then pissed yourself, and you were dragged out of the meeting a second time, while you were screaming The audacity of NOPE, which sounds like some weird tea party slogan. <br /><br />Amir: I'm a member.  <br /><br />Jake: [Amir tries tickling jake again] Yeah, like that feels like I'm being poked with cold crab claws.  <br /><br />Amir: [Holding up a 100$ bill and trying to burn it with a lighter while Jake tries to stop him] Alright come on, just let go man.  <br /><br />Jake: You did not learn your lesson yet. That'll be 300$ on the day!<br /><br />Ok, then so even though the debt ceiling was raised, our credit rating dropped so the stocks tanked.  <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, that's why I keep my money in a freaking box, man.  <br /><br />Jake: That's not smart.  <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, well didn't you lose money this year?  <br /><br />Jake: Yes.  <br /><br />Amir: .. and in 2008?  <br /><br />Jake: Right i did but...   <br /><br />Amir: Well my box didn't depreciate in value, ok, I actually made more money investing in Nothing [laughs].  <br /><br />Jake: Fine, where's your box?  <br /><br />Amir: Here's a quiz.. I lost it.  <br /><br />Jake: So then from inside the meeting we heard you threaten to make your face red until you passed out, which I guess you did, because then nobody heard from you for 30 minutes.  <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, which felt like like a second on my end.  <br /><br />Jake: Right, because you had stopped breathing.  <br /><br />Amir: For like a second on my end.  <br /><br />Jake: Yes, on your end, but like for 30 minutes in real life.  <br /><br />[Amir tries to flick his fingers]  <br /><br />Jake: Booyakasha?  <br /><br />Amir: Borat, yeah. Ok, so how do you know so much?  <br /><br />Jake: Newspapers, alright, it's not hard to stay informed; you read an hour a day, New York Times, Wall Street Journal..  <br /><br />Amir: How do you actually know so much?  <br /><br />Jake: Daily show..(Amir: got it) I watch the Colbert Report.  <br /><br />Amir: Yeah..

(Puts a dollop of mayo in the blender) <br /><br />This is gross to some.<br /><br />Jake: It's gross to all. I think I'm gonna puke.<br /><br />Amir: Do it in the blender!<br /><br />Jake: Aw, come on.<br /><br />Amir: It's funny, if you would have told me three years ago that I'd be here, blending—I would have burnt you at the stake for being a <br /><br />witch. But, you would have been right.<br /><br />Jake: Hey hey hey, look. If you have any respect for me, for yourself, you will not drink that.<br /><br />Amir: Bottoms up.<br /><br />(Amir chugs a glass of the liquid)<br /><br />Jake: You okay?<br /><br />Amir: I'm good.<br /><br />Jake: That was good?<br /><br />Amir: That was kosher.<br /><br />Jake: You sure you're alright? You look a little—<br /><br />Amir: I'm blind.<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: I'm blind, yeah, it got, like, darker and blurrier the more I drank, and then by the end—I'm blind, 100%!<br /><br />Jake: Why would have kept drinking?!<br /><br />Amir: I thought it was a gimmic or something!<br /><br />Jake: You have to start learning words, man.<br /><br />Amir: What's the point, I can't frikking see!<br /><br />Jake: Okay, relax. I'm gonna induce vomiting. Okay?<br /><br />Amir: How?<br /><br />Jake: I'm gonna come over there and stick my finger down your throat until you throw up.<br /><br />Amir: Don—have you left yet?<br /><br />Jake: Alright, here we go.

Let it up!<br /><br />(Amir removes Jake's finger from his mouth)<br /><br />Amir: It's fine, okay? I can see! I got my vision back by the time you got over here.<br /><br />Jake: Then why would you let me do that?!<br /><br />Amir: I wanted to see if you were gregarious. Ohhh! Turns out? Ya were.<br /><br />(Amir pukes)<br /><br />Jake: Aw, aw!<br /><br />Amir: We puked! Who saw us puke?<br /><br />Jake: I didn't pu—you just puked!<br /><br />Amir: We did it!<br /><br />",

Did you get into the Egg Box yet?<br /><br />Amir: You mean this file cabinet?<br /><br />Rick Fox: What'd I say?<br /><br />Amir: You said Egg Box. You said did you get into his Egg Box yet. And no I didn't get into his Egg Box cause I think you welded it shut with that little torch of yours.<br /><br />Rick Fox: (holds up and lights torch) I was trying to break the lock.<br /><br />Amir: (frustrated) I know; and I was trying to tell you that it wasn't locked.<br /><br />Rick Fox: Look, in that box right there is where Jake keeps eggs.<br /><br />Amir: (growing more irritated) Why do you think that!? What do you think that?<br /><br />Rick Fox: (insulted that Amir would ask such a stupid question) Otherwise, why would it be locked?<br /><br />Amir: (resorting to hitting the desk) It wasn't locked man, remember! Uhhh...you're haha; you're really frustrating today, Rick Fox. Like it's cool that you come by, cause like you're tall and like-<br /><br />Rick Fox: Handsome.<br /><br />Amir: Famous.

Ok, you're starting to freak me out. Do you remember like five minutes ago you tied up Jake and locked him in the supply closet? (Rick Fox tries to recall said event)<br /><br />Jake: (half naked, tied up, and locked in the supply closet) This is insane! Rick Fox did this to me!<br /><br />Amir: Why'd you steal his clothes by the way?<br /><br />Rick Fox: (holds up a V-neck t-shirt) Look that kool katt tried to hot dog with a low V.<br /><br />Amir: I guess...<br /><br />Rick Fox: (throws down shirt) Look. (holds up three fingers) You got two options. <br /><br />Amir: Ok.<br /><br />Rick Fox: One, pay me all the money you owe me. Or two (points to egg box), break in there and get me all the eggs in the world.<br /><br />Amir: Ok you're the one who told me to bet on all those NBA games, man, remember!? And then you're like oh the NBA's locked out this season (Rick Fox plays the world's smallest violin), so all those bets are an instant loss!<br /><br />Rick Fox: Yeah, instant loss.<br /><br />Amir: By the way, there might not be any eggs in here, ok; let alone, I think you said, all the eggs in the world. So. Just trying to temper your expectations, ya know?

Oh!<br /><br />Jake: Kickstarter is meant for like meaningful projects, like albums or films. <br /><br />Amir: I know.<br /><br />Jake: You know that? <br /><br />Amir: Yeah. <br /><br />Jake: So you think the Amir Blumenfeld Foundation For Not Giving A Shit is a meaningful project? <br /><br />Amir: It's..an album. And it's a film. <br /><br />Jake: No, it's not. Do you really expect people to donate?<br /><br />Amir: When you ask like that, definitely, okay? Besides, we give little bonuses to incentivize donations. <br /><br />Jake: I do see that--five dollars and you get a pin that says I'm Cheap James, bitch. <br /><br />Amir: If you're not cracking up right now, you've never seen the Chapel Show, okay?

What's a bitch taco? <br /><br />Amir: It's a taco with double the meat, double the shell, and if ya even think twice about eating it, I get to punch ya in the back of the head 'cause guess what?--<br /><br />Jake: I'm being a bitch. <br /><br />Amir: You're being a bitch, right. <br /><br />Jake: Cool, you know what? It's people like you that ruin Kickstarter for real artists like me...and other people. <br /><br />Amir: You're a real artist?<br /><br />Jake: Good question.

Danger of missing that cupcake! (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: You swore on your father's life that you just witnessed a double murder. You were hiding in a garbage can because you saw two Puerto Rican deli workers get hacked to bits? Your voice mail ended with you saying I think they see me and then six minutes of screaming.<br /><br />AMIR: How'd you like to be famous on YouTube?<br /><br />JAKE: I wouldn't.<br /><br />AMIR: Bull spit. Hey, that's my friend Basilio, okay?

I didn't get a good vantage point of it.<br /><br />JAKE: Did you feel like you ran up the wall and did a back flip?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, maybe. It just... Basilio says that you lose yourself in the zone, right? You get into like this zone and you just sort of can't really tell what's going on anymore, so maybe I stuck it and I just wasn't aware.<br /><br />JAKE: He hits a zone, you hit the wall.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I think I did it. I think I stuck the landing too, which is the hardest part, right B?<br /><br />JAKE: Your first reaction was to say Ah, ganked that. Do you think that was a good thing?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a great thing in parkour, it's a great thing to say that.<br /><br />BASILIO: It's not.<br /><br />AMIR: What do you know, man, okay? You don't know jack. It is!<br /><br />JAKE: He's the professional, and he says it's not.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well he's a little bitch that knows less about parkour than you do! (groans with pain)<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, don't do that. He's obviously being nice and trying to teach you.<br /><br />BASILIO: I wasn't teaching him anything; he's been following me around with his video camera for three hours!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, freestyle walking is all about self expression!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow!

You know, everybody else looks normal here, what are you wearing?<br /><br />(Zooms out to reveal Amir is wearing a pink onsie.)<br /><br />AMIR: (Shrugs)  Jeans.<br /><br />JAKE: They're clearly not jeans.  It's some pink onsie.<br /><br />(Amir turns around to reveal a poop stain on the rear of the onsie)<br /><br />JAKE: And you shit yourself!<br /><br />AMIR: I got excited.<br /><br />JAKE: Not a good reason.  That's a bad reason to shit in your pants.  And like, you scotch taped mistletoe above your...<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, my D, 'cause I'm tryna get it kissed.<br /><br />(Jake shakes his head)<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: You have fresh shit in your onsie and you're trying to get your dick sucked?  <br /><br />AMIR: It's called a blumpkin, alright?

But it's a holiday season, a season of second chances. right?  So why don't you say we put aside our differences for 12 hours, we go downstairs, we have the best holiday party this company has ever—OH!<br /><br />(Jake runs to Amir's rescue as Amir chokes and is being lifted up by his coworkers with the noose around his neck)<br /><br />AMIR: JAKE!<br /><br />MURPH: Let's drop him on 3!

Hey, follow me on Twitter. <br /><br />Jake: Oh, come on.<br /><br />Amir: What? At me!<br /><br />Jake: You showed up outside the soup kitchen this morning completely high. You were handing out water bottles filled with Vodka to people, saying one free bottle of godwater to anybody who goes home right now and skips dinner. You know you got twelve people to leave.<br /><br />Amir: I feel like this is a public shaming of me.<br /><br />Jake: It is. You know what, it is.

It was perfect!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: You gotta be kidding me with this! It was perfect! Unhh!<br /><br />Jake: What are you talking about?<br /><br />Amir: Facebook just jumped the shark. Okay, they had a perfect game going and they overdid it! Okay, trust me, I follow a lot of design Tumblrs, so I know when I see things that are overdone, and they overdid it.<br /><br />Jake: What's wrong with it?<br /><br />Amir: It's different. Which means it's bad. Which means I'm pissed. Okay, the big three.<br /><br />Jake: Those all sound like one thing.<br /><br />Amir: No, I've kept quiet till now, but I'm gonna make a Facebook group about it.<br /><br />Jake: You didn't keep quiet at all! You found out about it 10 seconds ago and you were yelling about it ever since. And looking at your Facebook profile, it looks like, wow, yeah, you've protested every single Facebook redesign!<br /><br />Amir: I deleted those groups!<br /><br />Jake: First of all, you didn't. Second of all, that doesn't change my point. Look at this first group, okay? Four years ago: Ten thousand strong against the Facebook newsfeed—<br /><br />Amir: Newsfeed, yeah.<br /><br />Jake: Facebook was flawless and now it's garbage. They had a perfect game going.<br /><br />Amir: It was garbage. Yeah, they jumped the shark.<br /><br />Jake: Fine. Six months later you wrote, Holy carp, why change perfection? Facebook is without flaw, but new design change makes it official: they just jumped the shark. A hundred thousand strong against this Obamanation.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, that group was partly political.<br /><br />Jake: Right.<br /><br />Amir: And guess what? It filled up.<br /><br />Jake: No it didn't. No members—you're not even a member! Jesus Christ! Next one: Delete the Facebook Graffiti Wall. It's a joke and a fool. Two weeks later: One million strong to bring back Graffiti Wall. I know I abused it, but I miss it.<br /><br />Amir: Straight up, they jumped the carp, when they lost the Graffiti Wall. Like...<br /><br />Jake: Lemme ask you a question: do you notice a pattern?<br /><br />Amir: [In a whiny and very high-pitched voice] Yeah, Facebook jumps the frickin' shark, okay? Every time they have a perfect game going and they fricking sell out! They jump the carp!<br /><br />Jake: Oh my god, your voice is painful! Look, here's another thing man: every single week you try to start a national Deactivate Facebook Day. Like, here's one that says Zark Fuckerberg is gonna start charging for Facebook. Please read now and delete your account.<br /><br />Amir: He started. He started charging, seven bucks a pop.<br /><br />Jake: No he didn't!<br /><br />Amir: He didn't, because enough people joined the group!<br /><br />Jake: You just lied, then, cause you said he did start charging.<br /><br />Amir: Oh my god, the facts are in on Twitter: Facebook was perfect but they just made it Myspace! NO!<br /><br />Jake: You know you said that two years ago: Ten million strong against the new Facebook, cause they just made it Myspace.<br /><br />Amir: [Crying] Yeah, cause it sucked!<br /><br />Jake: Oh my god, stop crying! You just said it was perfect. The same version you hated two years ago, you just called it perfect.<br /><br />Amir: Garbage becomes perfect over time as you get used to the garbage and forget what made it so bad. Like, you don't get the Internet and commenting in general, so it's not even worth saying—<br /><br />Jake: By the way, have you been to Myspace recently? It's just a music video website. There's no profiles or anything.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, you know why?<br /><br />Jake: Cause they jumped the shark—<br /><br />Amir: Cause they jumped the car—the, yeah—the shark, exactly right.<br /><br />Original Location<br /><br />Spare me your change.<br /><br />",

Cause it's working.<br /><br />Jake: I'm just saying it was nice to see my family, it was fun to hang out with my friends from high school...<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I wasn't home for but two minutes before the old man offers me a grilled jizz sandwich.  Curious, I say yes, and he chucks a cast iron skillet at the back of my face.<br /><br />Jake: The back of your face?<br /><br />Amir: The back of my fricken' face!  Yeah, hit me square and crack goes my weasel.<br /><br />Jake: Hey! Don't ruin my day with this sad sad story...uncross the eyes, there it is.<br /><br />Amir: So I say nope not this year, not again, I'm better than this, and I book it like a librarian as my dad threatens to move.  Only problem is, Uh oh, mommy's lying supine underneath my back tires threatening to sue me if I run over her head like a fricken' coconut.<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ...<br /><br />Amir: My Hanukkah wish, didn't come true cause my old man is just pushin' the hood of the car beggin' to the only god he knows to run the bitch over and I'm ridin' shotgun with my hand on the E-brake while the old maid is in the back fricken' planking underneath my back tires, kissing the pavement, begging me to fucking run her over too.  I'm crying like a coward up there right, screaming It's a set-up, it's a set-up!<br /><br />Jake: Why did you even go home?!<br /><br />Amir: I was asking myself the same question when my dad popped a squat on the windshield of my rented Kia Sorento and tried to drop a deuce.<br /><br />Jake: Tried?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! Tried.  Turns out he didn't have to go and the only thing he could muster was a little bit of pee and a shart roughly the size of a dead tadpole.  Looked like a mud-covered slug and stank like a pug.  So I flip on the old windshield wipers, throw the Sorento into drive and crash through my parents garage.  Flip a U-bang and I start humming to myself ♪Silent Night♪.  Only problem is I'm sad as hell.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I would be too.<br /><br />Amir: But I figure hey, 'tis the season who doesn't love a second chance so I swing by the mall and buy my dad a two thousand dollar watch.  Yeah, a gold roly-poly for that oldy-trolly.<br /><br />Jake: Oh no...<br /><br />Amir: Oh no is...wrong!  Yeah, turns out gold isn't his color because when I get home the entire house is gutted, empty, and there's a note on what's left of the door that says here died a happy family, RIP, thanks to you, Amir.  Can you believe that?  Callin' me out like that?  Rawdoggin' me in front of my girl.<br /><br />Jake: So oh no was right, by the way, and, what girl?<br /><br />Amir: Oh that's another thing.  I brought home a Thai whore just to show my dad that I had a mate in life.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you want his affection?  It sounds like he's a terrible person.<br /><br />Amir: He means well.<br /><br />Jake: No, he doesn't.  How could he possibly mean well?<br /><br />Amir: How's this for a happy ending?  New Years Eve Eve, December 39th.<br /><br />Jake: Wrong.<br /><br />Amir: I get a call from a jail in Fresno saying that they locked my old man up and threw away the key.  I'm alone, not doing anything anyway so I toss on a wig and hoof it down to the 'No to bail his ass out.  He pretends he doesn't even recognize me, his only daughter!<br /><br />Jake: You haven't been right about any of the things you've said, well, ever.<br /><br />Amir: I spend another 15K trying to bail him out of that Alabam Slamma' and he tells the bailiff he'd rather rot in hell than owe that son of a bitch coward, me, a fricken' dime.  Wanna know the icing on the cake?<br /><br />Jake: Not really.<br /><br />Amir: Me and my dad made up and he's coming to live with me in NYC, the big crapple.<br /><br />Jake: That sounds like the worst idea ever.<br /><br />Amir: I thought so too, but he promised to make me a grilled jizz on day one.<br /><br />Jake: Isn't that just when he knocks you out with a...<br /><br />Amir: Cast iron skillet, yeah, right to the back of my fricken' face.  But at least I have a dad.<br /><br />Jake: I have a dad.<br /><br />Amir: I'm talking about Pat.<br /><br />Pat: You monster!<br /><br />",

Who is this guy?!<br /><br />AMIR: He's-<br /><br />JAKE: What do you- You don't know what beef is?<br /><br />AMIR: He's kidding.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not kidding.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Well are you kidding?<br /><br />JAKE: No. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: (to Amir) Surely, he's kidding.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) He's kidding.<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) I'm not kidding.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: (to Amir) Thank grood-ness.<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you think that cows are the number 1 killer in all the world? What about, car accidents?<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Uh, half the cars in the United States and Milwaukee are all driven by bovines.<br /><br />JAKE: Milwaukee is in the United States and no, that's not true. Where did you get that information?<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Saw it in a documentary. (point to Amir) You should see it. It's called The Far Side by Gary Larson.<br /><br />AMIR: Is it on Netflix?<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Uh, I think it's on Netflix In-staunt.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, not how you pronounce it. That's a cartoon.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Uh, a cartoon based on facts.<br /><br />JAKE: A cartoon based on jokes.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: A cartoon based on jokey facts.<br /><br />(Amir and Mountain Hiker start to laugh and start at each other while they continue to laugh)<br /><br />JAKE: Just-just jokes. Just don't laugh like that. Oh God. What are you guys doing? Just making each other laugh like this? Why? (to Amir) Are you flirting right now? Is this how you flirt with each other?<br /><br />(Mountain Hiker punches Jake in the face)<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Hold back, hold back, hold back.<br /><br />(Amir backs away)<br /><br />JAKE: OW!<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Moo moo.<br /><br />JAKE: No!<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Oh! You're not a cow.<br /><br />JAKE: Why did you think I was a cow?<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Ugh, the way you were using your cow-y fingers I was almost certain of it that time.<br /><br />JAKE: Fingers? Cows have hooves.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: (Laughs) Cows has hooves! (To a tree) You hear that, Tree? Cows has hooves. (Laughs) Next thing you're going to tell me is that top hats don't have tops. (Laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: Draw a cow!<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: I can't draw a cow. There's not enough time.<br /><br />JAKE: It'll take you 2 seconds.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: Okay, stop. You could give me 2 months straight and all I have to do is draw a cow, and even then, I couldn't draw a fucking cow.<br /><br />JAKE: That is so sad.<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: We can talk about cows until they come home, but the fact of the matter remains your friend is missing and we must find him<br /><br />JAKE: First of all, he's not my friend. Second of all, he's not missing. He's right- <br /><br />(Amir is gone)<br /><br />JAKE: Where is he?<br /><br />MOUNTAIN HIKER: The hunt is on.

I'm serious, don't. (simultaneously) I've asked you so many times.<br /><br />BEN: (simultaneously) Yeah, well it's either smell or touch. Did you see which way he went?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't do either! I haven't seen which way he went, but he's dragging a net, he couldn't have gone far.<br /><br />BEN: Who is Anette, by the way?<br /><br />JAKE: No, not the name, he's dragging a net.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah, and I'm asking you who's Anette, 'cause I would love to meet her.

Why don't we strip down to our balls and dicks, rub against each other for warmth 'cause it's freezing out here?<br /><br />JAKE: How is that one better? By the way, dude, it's 90 degrees.<br /><br />BEN: 90 degrees cold, we should get in a hot-cold bath.<br /><br />JAKE: Focus!<br /><br />BEN: (simultaneously) Yeah, I'm focused up. I'm normal, I'm normally focused.<br /><br />JAKE: (simultaneously) Be normal! Be normal for a second, we have- No, you're not. We have to find Amir, we have to work together.<br /><br />BEN: Can you believe this? The irony of the whole thing? Me, working with a cow.

(laughs) Basically, you just need to freshen me up. Yeah, same guy in the park. No. No, not the freak-nerd in the net. (laughs) I'm a cool guy in a net. So, I can't believe there's a nerd around, also wearing a net. No, I did pay!<br /><br />(cut to Jake and Ben sitting on a rock)<br /><br />BEN: Knock-knock, knock-knock.

That's wasteful, it's gonna melt.<br /><br />GUY: Fine. Just take it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yess! Oh, and keep your phone on, Ok? I'm gonna call you in about 15 minutes for a third. Oh, and by the way, (spills first smoothie) Oh, yeah!<br /><br />GUY: You poured that all over your pants!<br /><br />AMIR: It's hard to do that in this net, Ok, at least I went for it.<br /><br />(cut to Jake and Ben walking down path, Ben hugging Jake)<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you gotta walk on your own for a minute.<br /><br />BEN: Hey, are you getting tired?<br /><br />JAKE: No, I'm not tired.<br /><br />BEN: 'Cause I could tickle you to keep you awake.

It's like how you can make fun of my mom, but I can't. <br /><br />Jake: That's not how that works. <br /><br />Amir: It's 'cause I'm too close to her, but you have a lot of material to work with--she's dumb and short.

How Many Words Would It Take by Amir Valarie Blumenfeld.<br /><br />JAKE: You know you can change your middle name, right?<br /><br />AMIR: (Reciting poem)  How many words would it take to accurately express what you mean to me?  How can you scientifically quantify how much lighter I become when you enter my day and how heavy I feel when you leave?  How can I describe how my smile just appears magnetically when  I see your face?  (Jake smiles)  How can I possibly count my thoughts of you when I think of you so constantly?  As thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts, within thoughts make it impossible to remember where one began and the other ended.  Time folds into itself as I am already nostalgic for our future and look forward to our past.  For the rest of my life, I love you.  <br /><br />(There is a short pause as Jake tries to find the words to say)<br /><br />JAKE: Wow...that was...<br /><br />AMIR: DUMB, I know!  (Chuckles)<br /><br />JAKE: No, it was good.  It was really, really good.<br /><br />AMIR: I texted the first part of it to myself while I was takin' a shit.<br /><br />JAKE: Dude, it was incredible.<br /><br />AMIR: And the second part, I was mid-wipe so I just said \"fuck it, I'll leave it as a voicemail to myself\".  Haha.  Are you crying?<br /><br />JAKE: (Wiping eyes)  Yeah!  I welled up a little.  Who're you giving that to?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, I just freestyled it off the top of my dick, probably nobody; I'm gonna can it.

It was better than yours and now it's gone!   <br /><br />AMIR: (Points at the heart shaped piece of paper in Jake's hand) What about that?<br /><br />JAKE: It's a placeholder.  It's a suckier version of the card I wrote; a dummy version.    <br /><br />AMIR: Read it.<br /><br />JAKE: I'll read it to you and if you think it's shwing-worthy then it might just be my actual card.<br /><br />AMIR: Um...sh—<br /><br />JAKE: (Clears throat obnoxiously)  (Begins to recite poem)  You are blazing to me.  You are so blazing.  No, you're better than blazing; you're blazin'.  No 'g', just an apostrophe, you don't need a 'g', 'cause I'm your G.  So we drop the 'g'.  (Amir scratches his head)  And tonight, you gonna drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it ain't whack, Girl.  Love, your not-so-secret-admirerer, J-Witz.

They choreographed it.<br /><br />Jake: That seems less likely.<br /><br />Amir: You'd be surprised.<br /><br />Jake: I am surprised.<br /><br />Amir: This one's pretty messed up actually, it's about 300 pages of bomb schematics and pictures of Leron taking a dump on public libraries, which he swears to God is not illegal. And then <br /><br />there's, like, a personal treatise devoted to how tipping isn't technically mandatory.<br /><br />Jake: That's true.<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: Tipping's not mandatory. You don't have to do it. But, a lot of waiters and service persons rely on the income<br /><br />Amir: Holy guac, I'm never tipping again. What about gifts?<br /><br />Jake: What about gifts?<br /><br />Amir: Gifts! Yeah! You know, for birthdays, weddings, funerals, of that nature.<br /><br />Jake: Don't bring a gift to a funeral.<br /><br />Amir: Something small, something nice.<br /><br />Jake: No! Right, buddy? Come on. Have you been to a funeral?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I've been to hundreds.<br /><br />Jake: Look. Just try to unlearn whatever you just read about in Leron's ezine.<br /><br />Amir: [On the phone] Mickey my friend! How are you? Long time caller, first time not-giving-a-shitter. You know how last week I crashed your daughter's onesie? Yeah, her one year old <br /><br />birthday party at the kiddie gym. Showed up drunk as a kite and promised her the best gift money couldn't buy? Well guess what, Mickey? That ship has docked. Go outside Mickey and try to pretend it's not Thanksgiving, because your eyes are about to feast on the sickest jungle gym you've ever seen. This one's so big it's a goddamn rainforest gym! Splinter-free and polished since '93 in Holished.<br /><br />Jake: Stupid rhyme.<br /><br />Amir: [On the phone] You opening the door Mickey? Yeah, check it out Mickey. You're looking at nothing, Mickey. Cause you know what, Mickey? Gifts ain't legal, Mickey!<br /><br />Jake: Yes they are.<br /><br />Amir: [On the phone] The only thing I have to get you, Mickey, is a visit from my friend Jonathan Squat AKA jack shit. Yeah, you lied to me Mickey, you pressured me with fake social norms <br /><br />Mickey, and for that I urge you to attend your local chocolate factory and go fudge yourself! [Hangs up] Unh!<br /><br />Jake: God that was impressive.<br /><br />Amir: Thank you.<br /><br />Jake: Do you plan that out? Like the, Go outside and pretend it's not Thanksgiving, feast your eyes on this, you plan that out?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah. Yeah yeah, it's all scripted.<br /><br />[Amir displays the script to Jake]<br /><br />Jake: Wow. Learn the alphabet.<br /><br />Original Location<br /><br />Gratuity is gratuitous.<br /><br />",

Jake looks up at Amir, and Amir looks away.)<br /><br />Jake: What were you doing? Just staring at me?<br /><br />Amir: New shirt.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah.<br /><br />Amir: I know yeah. You don't have to say yeah. I know it is.<br /><br />Jake: You said new shirt, what do you want me to say to that? How should I respond?<br /><br />Amir: Say I know you know. You know I know.<br /><br />Jake: I'm trying to—<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: I didn't finish talking. You interrupted me and you said what, mid-sentence.<br /><br />Amir: Short sleeve.<br /><br />Jake: It's actually long sleeve, rolled it up.<br /><br />Amir: It is new though, right?<br /><br />Jake: It's new, yeah.<br /><br />(Amir sighs, then they abruptly start talking over each other)<br /><br />Amir: Where'd you get the shirt? Tell me where you got it!<br /><br />Jake: I'm not gonna tell you where I bought the shirt. Stop! Why do you wanna know? Why do you care?!<br /><br />Amir: Because I want it too! That's why I wanna know, because I want to get the shirt too!<br /><br />Jake: Yea—I'm not—okay, so that's exactly why I don't want to tell you.<br /><br />Amir: I'm not gonna wear it on the same day as you, I'm gonna wear it on different days. We can alternate. People won't ever see us <br /><br />wearing the same shirt at the same time. Yeah, they won't say, Oh okay, those two guys are wearing the same shirt. It won't look like <br /><br />a mirror image!<br /><br />Jake: I don't want to give you [...] go out there wearing the same shirt. You want everyone to think we're twins? You want that to <br /><br />happen! I—oh my god. I don't want that—if you want it to happen, I don't want it to happen. That's why I'm not gonna tell you.<br /><br />Amir: So yeah, I'll wear it Monday Wednesday Friday, you wear it on Tuesday Thursday, how's that? How's that for a plan?<br /><br />Jake: That's—it's a bad plan.<br /><br />Amir: How about I get the same shirt as you? It won't even be the same size, it'll be two different shirts, (incoherent babbling), in <br /><br />the same style, same style as it! I—I'm really really stressed out, because I'm afraid that at the end of the day you're not gonna...<br /><br />Jake: I hate—right, right, right, it's—your veins are popping out of your neck so bad! Breathe! Breathe in! Breathe in! Stop yelling <br /><br />and breathe! For three seconds.<br /><br />(Amir stops yelling)<br /><br />Jake: Five, four, alright—<br /><br />Amir: I'm afraid that you're not even gonna end up telling me what shirt!<br /><br />Jake: Oh my god! You... Oh... You know what, you couldn't pull this shirt off. [...] You won't look good in this shirt! This shirt—it's <br /><br />a bad shirt, but I'm a fucking attractive dude so I make it work for me. You know what I'm saying?<br /><br />Amir: Because I can't, like—what I'm gonna walk into a store and go, like, Hey, can I get one that's red and plad just like Jake? <br /><br />They won't know who you are! I'm gonna take a picture and send it to you, but, like, what's that gonna get done? At the end of the day? <br /><br />Give me a range. Give me a range. Give me a range, okay? Give me, like, 10 stores, I'll go to each one and I'll figure out which shirt <br /><br />you're wearing.<br /><br />Jake: You—no—that's so pathetic. You're just gonna walk into—?<br /><br />Amir: Why is that pathetic? That I wanna wear a cool shirt? You're wearing that shirt, are you pathetic?<br /><br />Jake: What—? You're about to cry! You're about to cry! Look at your eyes. Look at your eyes.<br /><br />Amir: (Babbling) Are you pathetic? Are you pathetic? Are you pathet—And it's not like I wanna wear one on the same day! It's not like <br /><br />I'm gonna wear it on the same day! We can alternate days!<br /><br />Jake: Oh you want to alternate! So that means, like, I have to call you before work—I have to check in with you to see if you're <br /><br />wearing my shirt!<br /><br />Amir: You wear it on Monday, I can wear it on Tuesday, you can wear it on Wednesday, I wear it on Thursday, you wear it on Friday, I <br /><br />wear it on Saturday, you wear it Sunday, I can wear it Monday, you can wear it on Tuesday, I can wear it on Wednesday. That's how we <br /><br />should—<br /><br />Jake: I'm not—then we can just share this shirt by your logic, right? Yeah—<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! I wanna do that! I wanna share clothes with you, but I feel like I would sort of ease into that, by getting the same <br /><br />clothes as you, and then you'd realize that, why are we wasting so much money!<br /><br />Jake: Knowing that you wanna do that ultimately really freaks me out. Stop—I wanna s—<br /><br />Amir: We should just wear the same clothes! We can wear the same clothes! Put them in the same—!<br /><br />(They stop yelling over each other)<br /><br />Jake: FINE! I got it at Forever 21! Okay? Are you happy now? Forever 21! There's a unisex section upstairs!<br /><br />(Amir is suddenly wearing the same shirt)<br /><br />Amir: I got the shirt. I said I wouldn't get the shirt, and I did. I did get the shirt. I called your bluff, and you lost.<br /><br />Pat: Woah, woah, twinsies! Did you guys plan that, or...?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />",

      "script": "[NOTE: because there is a lot of play with the pronunciation of the word bagel in this episode, it was a little tough to transcribe in some areas.  If anyone has suggestions for how to improve those areas of the script, as well as the script in general, I'm happy to make adjustments]<br /><br />INTRO<br /><br />Jake: You're watching Jake and Amir!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: Why are your hands so sticky?<br /><br />Amir: I don't know!<br /><br />EPISODE<br /><br />[Several people are standing, quietly preparing bagels]<br /><br />Amir: I had a fuck dream last night.<br /><br />[Everyone but Jake leaves]<br /><br />Jake [as crowd dissipates]: Come on.  Oh, sorry. [to Amir] What are you doing?<br /><br />Amir: What? I brought bagels* for the whole company and you're doggin' on me for mentioning, just mentioning that I had a dream? I haven't even gotten into the lurid details yet. And they are wet.<br /><br />*[Amir pronounces bagel \"bag-el\" as opposed to \"bei-gel\", which is the normal pronunciation]<br /><br />Jake: It was inappropriate.<br /><br />Amir: You bet your ass it was.  Imagine every koala ever, in a bikini.<br /><br />Jake: Did you buy bagels for everybody just so you can act like an asshole?<br /><br />Amir: Ok, fine, congratulations for this.  Guys, everyone throw up your bagels right now.  Throw them up or start paying me for them.<br /><br />Jake: You can't do that.<br /><br />Amir: Guess what? Everyone owes me two bucks now because Jake's doggin' me.  We'll call it a \"Jake doggin' me fee.\"<br /><br />Jake: You showed up with bagels around your nipples.<br /><br />Amir: As a joke.<br /><br />Jake: You said \"bagels on me.\"<br /><br />Amir: As a joke.<br /><br />Jake: And now, you're demanding money, not as a joke, right? You can't do that, it's fucked up.  It's a form of robbery.  It's extortion.  It's also pronounced bagel.<br /><br />Amir: What am I saying?<br /><br />Jake: You're saying bagel.<br /><br />Amir: Right, bagel.<br /><br />Jake: No, wrong it's-<br /><br />Amir: Bagel.<br /><br />Jake: It's-<br /><br />Amir: Bagel.<br /><br />Jake: Let me say it.  Because you said it wrong three times in a row, ok?<br /><br />Amir: Bagel.<br /><br />Jake: Let's go one syllable at a time.<br /><br />Amir: Ok.<br /><br />Jake: Say \"beig\"<br /><br />Amir: Daeg.<br /><br />Jake: \"el\" [with a soft \"e\"]<br /><br />Amir: \"el\" [with a hard \"e\"]<br /><br />Jake: Bagel.<br /><br />Amir: Baeg-el.<br /><br />[Jake shakes his head]<br /><br />Amir: Worse, right?<br /><br />[Emily enters and begins to get a bagel]<br /><br />Amir: Woah, three bucks! You prick in a wig! Three bucks!<br /><br />Jake: Relax, dude.<br /><br />Amir: You owe me money you skinny bitch!<br /><br />[Murph enters]<br /><br />Murph: Eh! Cool it! That's my girlfriend, buddy.<br /><br />Jake: No way, how long?<br /><br />Murph: Fuck you!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus. You know, dude, she didn't even take a bagel.<br /><br />Amir: Bagel! You frickin' nimrod!<br /><br />Jake: You never had any intention at all of giving these away for free, did you?<br /><br />Amir [suddenly wearing black and white striped sunglasses]: I hustle. Ok?<br /><br />Jake: I hate that you can put those on so quickly.<br /><br />Amir: I spend a penny to make two. Do you know what it's like to grow up on the street? To be hood? Or would you rather just suck off Uncle Sam and swallow what he gives ya? By the way, that was my dream last night.<br /><br />Jake: You have a job. You could make so much more money doing a good job here, in the office. Did you really blow Uncle Sam in your dream last night?<br /><br />Amir [no longer wearing sunglasses]: I could clear five dollars easy street if all y'all just ponied up six dollars apiece for these Ed Bagley juniors! Ok, make my money work for me!<br /><br />Jake: That's not even- how much did you spend on these bagels?<br /><br />Amir [pulls out a receipt]: Roughly...<br /><br />[Jake pulls the receipt out of his hand]<br /><br />Amir: Don't grab stuff out of my hand, ok? I was gonna bring it up earlier but I was gonna wait-<br /><br />Jake [angrily]: Six hundred dollars! I think you got ripped off.<br /><br />Amir: Look me in my eyes and actually tell me that you think I got ripped off.<br /><br />Jake: I just did. I think you got ripped off.<br /><br />[a moment passes]<br /><br />Amir: No, not buying that, you blinked.<br /><br />[Josh is shown vomiting]<br /><br />Jake: Oh, what is going on?<br /><br />Amir: Alright, listen up everybody. [makes morse code sounds] <br /><br />Jake: Say it!<br /><br />Amir: Y'all now have giardia.  Alright, straight up it's a rare form of food poisoning that lasts three weeks; we're talking vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, infantile jaundice!<br /><br />[More people begin to vomit]<br /><br />Jake [repulsed]: Oh!<br /><br />Amir: Don't worry there is a cure.<br /><br />Jake: What is it?<br /><br />Amir: Bedrest. And that information will cost you six hundred dollars, so... [wearing sunglasses] And I just made a profit!<br /><br />Jake: Take those off!<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

You rub your boner against women to prove to society that you're worth a shit.<br /><br />AMIR: Have you ever done it before?<br /><br />JAKE: Got really close once, but I got cocky, started tweeting #victory, scarred the bitch off.<br /><br />AMIR: Heheh.<br /><br />JAKE: Woulda' been a total loss, but I got victory trending in NYC.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow, really?<br /><br />JAKE: NOT the trending part!<br /><br />AMIR: Soo, do you do this every night, or...<br /><br />JAKE: Well not every night, usually I come here at like 4 PM. I have to get here before the bouncer because these clubs are exclusive as shit. Great question, I hide in the men's room and pretend I'm the janitor.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright dude, practice; pretend I'm a hot girl.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright.<br /><br />JAKE: (in a hot girl voice) Hey babe.<br /><br />AMIR: Hey! Your hair is too short and your voice is too low, call me if you wanna lose your dick!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God, my boy's got it! It's called negging, dude, insult the bitch and make her come to you!<br /><br />(the woman in front of them in line (Bridget Burke) gives Jake a disgusted look.)<br /><br />JAKE: (to Bridget, in a bad pickup line voice) Hey beautiful..<br /><br />JAKE: (to Bridget) FAKE tits, FAKE tan, fake Louis Vuitton; there ain't one real thing about ya, sister!<br /><br />BRIDGET: (sarcastically) ...Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Will you date me? Will you date me? Cuz I'll be exclusive, and you don't have to be. How's that for--<br /><br />(Amir tugs Jake's arm back, trying to save him from the trainwreck of a conversation.)<br /><br />JAKE: (to Amir) Dude! Dude don't touch me right now, I'm thirty seconds away from getting line-poon.<br /><br />JAKE: (to Bridget) One drink, okay I'm begging you, one drink, and then I'll grind on you like you've never been ground before.<br /><br />BRIDGET: If you lose that fedora,--<br /><br />(Jake quickly takes off his fedora.)<br /><br />BRIDGET: Let me finish. If you lose that fedora, and you go home, maybe I'll forget about how badly you embarrassed yourself in front of me.<br /><br />JAKE: Damn girl. Aight, you fly.<br /><br />BRIDGET: You're ugly to me.<br /><br />JAKE: Ahkey! Chill!<br /><br />[Amir is talking to the woman behind them in line, and Jake is leaning against the wall of the building.]<br /><br />JAKE: (to BRIDGET) Hey, why don't you dump your iPhone boyfriend and go out with this Man-Droid?<br /><br />BRIDGET: Oh my God that is the DUMBEST thing I have EVER HEARD.<br /><br />JAKE: Ooh my God! Stop being mean to me!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey everybody, check it out, I think there's a whale at this party, somebody's got a blow-hole. (He pushes his head back against the wall while pretending to blow into his thumb, creating the illusion of his hat rising up by being inflated.)<br /><br />JAKE: (to BRIDGET) Yo you're ugly! I wouldn't fuck you with his dick! (pointing at Amir)<br /><br />BRIDGET: You look like your chin grew pubes; I wouldn't let you fuck me with anyone's dick!<br /><br />JAKE: Ok well I wouldn't.. take his dick to fu-- You're a fuckin' ten. You're a ten, okay? Can I have your number?<br /><br />BRIDGET: No!<br /><br />JAKE: Here's my phone, put in your number. It doesn't even have to be the real number, I'll never call it<br /><br />[Amir is talking to the woman behind him, and Jake is doing the whale hat trick again.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey dude. (blows into his thumb, and Amir ignores him.) Dude!<br /><br />JAKE: (to Bridget, holding out his phone, slightly crying) It can be fake if you want, I'll chalk it up as a W. I just wanna show my boys that I got one number tonight!<br /><br />JAKE: (to Amir, doing a bad impression of Vince Vaughn's character Trent from Swingers.) I'm a big bear, man! I got these claws, and these fangs, and I'm just battin' the bunny around! (AMIR: What are you talking about?) With this, what do I do with the bunny- It's from Swingings! With Jon Favers, and Vince Vang!<br /><br />JAKE: (to Amir) Pop quiz, hotshot, do you have game?<br /><br />AMIR: Game?<br /><br />JAKE: It's called game. You use it to get with chicks, it's the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />AMIR: I lost my childhood dog today!<br /><br />JAKE: None due respect dude, FUCK your childhood dog!, ok, this is more important. You know Game of Thorns? This is Game of Thongs!<br /><br />AMIR: Game of Thorns?<br /><br />JAKE: Game of Thongs, I said. D-D-DO YA HAVE IT, GAME?<br /><br />JAKE: (awkwardly gyrating back and forth) Uh, you go find a girl, you grind on her, like this, oh hey (he starts grinding on the girl behind them in line, from the front, and a large black man comes from behind her, grabbing Jake and roughing him up) WHOA! DUDE, RELAX, I DIDN'T SEE A RING, DUDE!<br /><br />AMIR: He didn't see a ring!<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't see a ring!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, I see a ring.<br /><br />JAKE: You see a ring??<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I see a ring.<br /><br />JAKE: Auh she has a ring, dude?!<br /><br />END.<br /><br />OUTRO:<br /><br />[Jake and Amir have made it through the line, and Amir is showing his ID to the bouncer.]<br /><br />AMIR: Here ya go! So...<br /><br />BOUNCER: C'mon, this is a fake ID, man!<br /><br />AMIR: (to Jake) Busted, let's go home.<br /><br />JAKE: What are you doing, you're twenty-nine, why would you use this ID?!<br /><br />AMIR: I wanna be from Nebraska!<br /><br />",

What are you talking about? Suck my dick, okay, I ponied up the dough!<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't! Let's look back just last year. You were mathematically eliminated after the first day. You begged Johnson Hussey for your money back, when he finally gave it to you, you said, Keep the change you filthy animal. I'ma buy back in at a G. You submitted what turned out to be a perfect bracket and a thousand dollars in cash--<br /><br />AMIR: (quietly, doodling): Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: Then you showed up, rolling on E to our office party for the finals. You shredded the money, tore up your bracket and pissed on Sunusi's phone. You screamed, All contracts are null and Lloyd!

Will you just go to the bathroom?' Just once I'd like to go to the bathroom not because he's telling me but because I made the decision myself. Jake is chill as shit, but sometimes he's a nerd. I don't even have to go, it's like--(gas)--Oh, oh no. Wow, a little gas. Nothing to see here! -- (AMIR begins to shit, putting his hands on either side of the stall in clear pain). Oh no, here we go. Ohhh, mmmm, oh my God, (poops) poops I shitted again! Wow, that felt big! I'm gonna look down just in a case it's a-- holy shit, yeah, oh my (bleep) that's a record breaker. Three footer, easy, four soaking wet, two dry, two and a half moist, no coil either, just a straight shot. Thicker than a soda can, too. My God, it looks like a boa constrictor trying to get out of a septic tank. I'm a hero and a cool. I gotta snap a pic. W-w-wait! The minute I turn around to snap a pic, the toilet is gonna automatically flush! No! Oh my God! Stop crying, stop crying--okay, cry, cry, let it out, you deserve this! You don't cry that much and even if you did no one would begrudge these tears! Just cry, let it all out, then move past it! Okay okay okay, think! Think think think, you idiot. There's gotta be a way to snag a pic without getting up. Go through your legs. (AMIR tries) Nope, too dark. It's too fricken dark. Ugh, unbelievable. You caught a seventy pound bass and you have to throw it back before (AMIR punches stall wall) anybody even gets to behold its beauty! Good luck bragging about something that doesn't even exist! It looks like ten brown slinkies glued together and nobody's gonna believe a goddamn thing. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!<br /><br />PAT: (at urinal) Are you okay in there, man? It smells like cheese and gasoline.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm not okay! I just gave birth to a brown elephant trunk and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her to the great unknown!<br /><br />PAT: (holds nose) Oh my God, that is ripe! (leaves)<br /><br />AMIR: (thinking) Just stand up! Just stand up and do it, you coward! There's no way that log's getting flushed down anyway! No, no, no, greater fortunes have been lost on less risky propositions! You have to be rational here!<br /><br />(AMIR pulls out his phone and calls JAKE)<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, listen, it's me--don't hang up, don't hang up, don't hang up, okay? I don't want you to do anything weird, I just need you to come over here and put your hand over the sensor so I can stand up and take a picture of my enormous dump. Hello, hello? Ugh!<br /><br />AMIR: (thinking) Dildo! He's a dildo! Ugh! Think, think think think. Uh. This is what you have to do. Take off your shirt and pants, put them over the motion sensor so that it still thinks you're still sitting down, and stand up and take the pic right away! Ha! (claps in head) This makes me a genius, official genius and a cool. From now on nobody will think of Amir Blumenfeld as the guy who couldn't take a shit the size and girth of twelve rubber hoses banded together and dipped and brown paint, no! But rather as a pimp and a philosopher. The best two things you can be. <br /><br />(a MAN walks into the bathroom; upon smelling AMIR's stench, he immediately runs out)<br /><br />AMIR: (thinking) Okay, here we go, Hurwitz. Turn around and snag the pic. Your life as you know it will officially change. Promise me this. Whatever people say, you'll stay humble. (aloud) I promise. (thinking) Three, two, one...<br /><br />(AMIR stands up and tries to take the picture. His shirt, pants, and cell phone all are flushed, as well as his enormous dump)<br /><br />AMIR: Oh no! No, no, no!<br /><br />(new scene, back at the office. JAKE is working. AMIR walks in without shirt and pants on and sits down at his chair.)<br /><br />AMIR: By the way, I know what you're gonna say, but don't bother because I promised myself I'd stay humble, also, thanks for the bathroom suggestion, comprende.

Come on by! Later.<br /><br />AMIR: (on phone) Hey Micah, it's Amir. Your brother did not pick up the phone. I assume he's dead. I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but he's probably long gone. If you hear from him, have him call me, okay? I'm at P.G.I. Fugley's. Bye.<br /><br />AMIR: (on phone) Mrs. Hurwitz, Amir freaking, no, speaking. Both your sons are being coward factories.

Okay, cause then you make a pres out of um and e.<br /><br />Jake: That's not the phrase.<br /><br />Amir: Anyway you heard the call. Two normal people having a nice normal conversation.<br /><br />Jake: I think I see what happened here.

You welled up and you said, I'll show you you piece of clid.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: I'll show you I have a friend so normal you won't believe it. Then you sprinted out of the office and I haven't seen you since. <br /><br />I can only presume−<br /><br />Amir: Don't.<br /><br />Jake: −that you were eavesdropping on people's conversations, writing down everything you heard and then getting all of them wrong.<br /><br />Amir: I got all of them right!<br /><br />Jake: No, you didn't! You don't consider things dumb!<br /><br />Amir: You consider me dumb!<br /><br />Jake: Right, because you also don't play things by year.<br /><br />Amir: Yes, I do!<br /><br />Jake: No, the phrase is you play things by ear.<br /><br />Amir: Oh okay so what are you, twelve ears old?<br /><br />Jake and Amir: What?!<br /><br />Jake: You should have heard more than those five phrases by the way. And you didn't leave any space, so I can't imagine what, what was <br /><br />his name? Dan?<br /><br />Amir: Den.<br /><br />Jake: Den? I can't imagine what Den was saying during that conversation.

Let's start the table read<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, you mean the anal bead<br /><br />(silence)<br /><br />MURPH: (laughs and whispers to Emily) It rhymed<br /><br />VINCENT: I meant the table read. It's when we read the scripts that were written this week, at this table, and then I get a sense of how to direct them. <br /><br />AMIR: I am the weakest link, goodnight. (looks at jake for reaction) <br /><br />VINCENT: Amir, let's start with your script because it is by far<br /><br />AMIR: (interrupting) The most viral!<br /><br />VINCENT: The longest is what I was going to say<br /><br />AMIR: It reads fast<br /><br />VINCENT: It doesn't. You wanna pick your cast?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes! Okay... Jake, why don't you play Darrel McMexican <br /><br />JAKE: Such an offensive name.<br /><br />AMIR: He's like a rogue CIA agent with a heart of cold.<br /><br />JAKE: But McMexican? <br /><br />AMIR: (To Emily) And Julia, why don't you play his girlfriend, Pussy Sandwich, which works since that's your actual name.<br /><br />EMILY: Emily. (Amir gives confused look) My name is Emily.<br /><br />AMIR: Right, what did I say?<br /><br />EMILY: Julia and then Pussy Sandwich<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, I think we're saying the same thing?<br /><br />EMILY: No <br /><br />AMIR: Are we not? <br /><br />VINCENT: (butting in) Alright, let's just get started.<br /><br />AMIR: And improvise! Have fun with it! But, stick to the script. That's the most fun you can have. You know, I'm married to the script. (whispering) But I'm willing to cheat. (laughs) <br /><br />VINCENT: Okay, um... (Reading Amir's script) Interior: doesn't matter. Day. A shot of an empty room for three hours. (To Amir) We can't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, we'll see. (winks)<br /><br />VINCENT: (reading) In stumbles our hero, Darrel McMexican. He looks just like Jake, a buff and a cool. <br /><br />JAKE: (reading) My heart, it's cold. I can't breathe.<br /><br />AMIR: (exasperated) CUT. Sorry...um, yeah. You're improvising. <br /><br />JAKE: First of all, you said we could <br /><br />AMIR: Which is fine, yeah<br /><br />JAKE: Second of all, I'm not improvising. <br /><br />VINCENT: (coughing to get everyone's attention) (reading) As Darrel grabs his heart, not just his chest but literally he grabs his heart, his girlfriend enters. 81 years young, jet black hair, like a jet, has Pussy Sandwich for a name.<br /><br />EMILY: (reading) Darrel, Darrel, Darrel McMexican, how are you? <br /><br />AMIR: You're improvising a little too much for my liking , but that's fine.<br /><br />JAKE: She's not improvising at all.<br /><br />EMILY: (reading) It's me. Pussy, Pussy Sandwich. I'm buxom and blonde as the sun.<br /><br />MURPH: Awesome babe, that was so hot<br /><br />(Emily licks Murph's hand, Murph glares at Jake) <br /><br />JAKE: (reading) I look at you and I want to know more about you. Are you a foodie?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, okay, great. So here comes the emotional crux of the whole...piece as it were. Please, as alway's improvise, adlib, yeah, but (pounds the table to get his point across) verbatim! I can't stress that enough. Stick to the script. <br /><br />VINCENT: (reading confusedly) Pussy Sandwich let's out a high pitched queef. We can't hear it, but everyone knows it's there for sure. Dogs from around the city start sprinting to McMexican's apartment. We hear thuds, barking, pounding. These dog's wanna get in and see what's what. They know it's coming from Pussy.

That was illegal.<br /><br />[Ben retorts calmly, but is drowned out each time by Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't want that! I shit in the copier, okay? Stop beating me up. Stop sucking me off. I shit in the copier!<br /><br />BEN: Well, that's funny... 'cuz that's impossible.<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />BEN: ...'Cuz I shit in the copier.<br /><br />[Jake sits in stunned silence.

Hey.<br /><br />JAKE: That's not impressive.<br /><br />BEN: It was me the whole time!<br /><br />[Amir continues clapping.

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake Jake Jake. Jake your booty.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop!<br /><br />AMIR: (joining Jake on couch) Hey, dude, thanks for meeting me here.<br /><br />JAKE: (simultaneously) Oh, bad odor!<br /><br />AMIR: So how do people make money today?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not meeting you here. Ok, I was just in here.<br /><br />AMIR: That's right, creating iPad apps.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't think that I agreed to a meeting. <br /><br />AMIR: And, what better way to create iPad apps than in a meeting that both people agreed to?<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, first app idea. You know how it's hard to manage your time, like time management?<br /><br />JAKE: Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: So this is just a list of other shit that's hard to deal with.<br /><br />JAKE: Really? Number one says wiping. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: That shouldn't be that hard.<br /><br />AMIR: And yet it is.<br /><br />JAKE: No it's not.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok.<br /><br />JAKE: (holds up iPad) Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce. <br /><br />AMIR: I was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.<br /><br />JAKE: You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!<br /><br />JAKE: Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.<br /><br />AMIR: That's an example of something I do all the time.<br /><br />JAKE: I know.<br /><br />AMIR: The hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.<br /><br />JAKE: What's the app?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm not always talking about apps.<br /><br />AMIR: So, you hate the Papua New Guinean community, I hate the Papua New Guinean community. So let's just agree-<br /><br />JAKE: Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community. <br /><br />AMIR: Ok. So this app might be a dud. (snorts)<br /><br />AMIR: This one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.<br /><br />JAKE: How?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your iPad. (chuckles)<br /><br />JAKE: Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-<br /><br />AMIR: Barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. That was a picture of-<br /><br />JAKE: Ribs.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right, how did you-<br /><br />JAKE: How is that not what it sounds like?<br /><br />AMIR: You're getting defensive.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my-<br /><br />AMIR: It's called Photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.<br /><br />JAKE: That app has been around for a while.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well I created a lens for it, called fisheye.<br /><br />JAKE: I feel so bad for you, man.<br /><br />AMIR: If you're gonna call me out on every single white lie I tell, just, just leave, I'm serious man.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. (gets up)<br /><br />AMIR: Bahh! When I'm done!<br /><br />JAKE: What is that noise?<br /><br />AMIR: What noise?<br /><br />JAKE: It just comes out of your mouth when I go to leave. (gets up)<br /><br />AMIR: I guess so- Bahh!<br /><br />AMIR: You're in a bad place right now and I feel like even if I pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.<br /><br />JAKE: You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?<br /><br />AMIR: (taps iPad) Alright.<br /><br />JAKE: Actually you know what? (takes iPad) I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my God, I have a case for it, relax.<br /><br />JAKE: The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.<br /><br />AMIR: Call me out. Call me out in front of all your big friends so that I can feel small. <br /><br />JAKE: Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't compartmentalize me like I'm a chore. <br /><br />JAKE: You spit all over my fucking arm just now.<br /><br />AMIR: (huggine Jake) I hate when we fight like this.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop!<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, so this one's a hoot and a half. (laughs briefly) What's the hardest part about reading?<br /><br />JAKE: Finding the time.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, never mind.<br /><br />JAKE: Your app idea just says the vowels.<br /><br />AMIR: Never mind, I said!<br /><br />AMIR: You try to put everything in a box. And if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away. (pause, reaches for hug) I'm sorry.<br /><br />JAKE: Get-<br /><br />AMIR: So you know how Instagram sold for (puts pinky to lip) one billion dollars?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: (laughs) So this would be an app that harasses the creators of Instagram until they give us a few million dollars to stop.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, don't take this as a compliment.<br /><br />AMIR: Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: That's your best app idea yet.<br /><br />AMIR: Appreciate it.<br /><br />JAKE: It's still terrible.<br /><br />AMIR: Danke.<br /><br />JAKE: It's just all your other ideas are so bad.<br /><br />AMIR: Gracias. (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: Ok, don't take this-<br /><br />AMIR: Todah rabah. <br /><br />JAKE: Fuck you!<br /><br />(pause, Amir recoils)<br /><br />AMIR: (whispers) Ouch.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, brace yourself 'cause this is not gonna be pleasant.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh no, constructive criticism!<br /><br />JAKE: Quit. <br /><br />AMIR: (faintly) Ow.<br /><br />JAKE: Not even quit while you're ahead, quit while you're behind. None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board. <br /><br />AMIR: Right, yeah, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.<br /><br />AMIR: That's fine, Ok.<br /><br />JAKE: Furthermore,<br /><br />AMIR: Oh?<br /><br />JAKE: You're not smart.<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: You're not getting better.<br /><br />AMIR: Nope.<br /><br />JAKE: You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself. You can't even take care of this iPad. So I say, let's toss out the iPad. We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: With your time.<br /><br />AMIR: At least I gave it the old college try, you know?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not sure you did.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, at least I tried my best, you know? (snorts)<br /><br />JAKE: That is sad, because it wasn't even close to being good enough.<br /><br />AMIR: (tapping couch) Absolutely (snorts) I just, uh. Quit it, alright, you're making me feel weak.<br /><br />JAKE: You are weak.<br /><br />AMIR: (raising voice) Enough! Ok, you're not creative!<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

It's called six months of pumping iron for this one moment.<br /><br />AMIR: Do you think that's a normal thing to wear around the office?<br /><br />JAKE: You think I'm not going to go to the park during lunch? I don't commit to wearing something that makes me feel vulnerable without having an airtight excuse for every line of questioning. Does that make me insecure? You bet your ass it does.<br /><br />AMIR: Just wear a T-Shirt, then, okay? You'll look normal and you won't be as angry.<br /><br />JAKE: GQ Teen says the summer look is Toms shoes, Ray Bans, board shorts, and a muscle tee. Or was that Joseph Gordon-Levitt doppelganger that I saw at the Starbucks on 9th Avenue not styling?<br /><br />AMIR: Doppelganger?<br /><br />JAKE: Wasn't one hundred percent sure it was the 3rd Rock from the Sun star and upon asking for his autograph, I found out it was not. Still snagged this sweet pic though. (shows Amir picture on his phone)<br /><br />AMIR: He looks pissed at you.<br /><br />JAKE: He was!<br /><br />AMIR: So why follow his fashion advice?<br /><br />JAKE: Because a sleeveless shirt for this piece of dirt makes that sweet pussy go squirt. (makes milk come out of his mouth)<br /><br />AMIR: How?<br /><br />JAKE: I 69'd my dad! At a rave!<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: I was obviously joking, the point is that I attend raves! And while I've never done anything more than kiss a bouncer on the cheek to get in and then be sold fake ecstasy by a sweaty teen, still cooler than your last Tuesday.<br /><br />AMIR: I guess-<br /><br />JAKE: -(mocking) I guess? Do you guess? Do you guess? (yelling) I shared a fucking glowing pacifier, dude, with a legit five-and-a-half. That's two points hotter than my last girlfriend.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: (does McDonald's jingle) Da da da dada I'm loving snatch!<br /><br />AMIR: That actually is a cool look.<br /><br />JAKE: No shlit, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: (rips the sleeves of his shirt off)<br /><br />JAKE: No, no! Hey don't you-<br /><br />AMIR: I'm going sleeveless! Yeah! A dank tank for this man stank make the poonani smell rank!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not a tank! Bad rhyme, doesn't count!<br /><br />PAT: (walks over, wearing a muscle tee) Woah, woah, hey hey! Look guys, guys: tank top triplets!<br /><br />JAKE: Get him outta here!<br /><br />AMIR: Get outta here, man!<br /><br />JAKE: Get him outta here!<br /><br />AMIR: (points to Jake) He 69'ed his dad!<br /><br />JAKE: At a rave!

Then he pounds the table with his pen to get the room's attention, and stands up.]<br /><br />AMIR: Alright. Listen up, everyone: I am your speaker. And despite what this guy thinks, [gestures toward the co-worker he wa talking to previously] I'm pretty damn good.<br /><br />[The co-worker laughs nervously.

No. Okay: what're we here to learn?<br /><br />CO-WORKER 3: Search engine optimization.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right. Now: what do I know about SEO? ...nothing.

Yeah, a skinny nerd tried to push her into the wall, failed, then started crying, and offered to cut her a four-thousand-dollar check to keep the whole thing under wraps.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh...<br /><br />JAKE: He said he didn't want everybody to know he was a punk bitch who couldn't even yoke up a forty-five-year-old dame with a heart of cold.<br /><br />AMIR: Guys, listen up: Ten thousand dollars to the person who can find that perp and bring him to me, dead or alive.<br /><br />JAKE: It was you.<br /><br />AMIR: Correctimundo!

That or a milky tan like this chair. <br /><br />Jake: THAT'S CREAM!<br /><br />Amir (mocking): That's cream!<br /><br />Jake: THAT'S CREAM and he left.<br /><br />Amir (speaking to the candidates): Hey guys I'm sorry to say but the search is over.

Yes, I am calling about your two-bedroom triplex on East 8th and 1st. She is a beaut. That's right, hot to trot and newsflash: I'm not!  Heh. But the asking price is quite nice, 8k a month plus utilities.<br /><br />Jake: Wow, expensive apartment.<br /><br />Amir: Let me make you an offer you CAN refuse. Heh. I'm writing it down on a slip of paper and let me just know if this offends you.<br /><br />(Amir holds up the piece of paper to the phone)<br /><br />Jake: Hey that's not gonna work.  It just won't work.<br /><br />Amir: Okay I will take your silence to mean that you've accepted my counter of eleven dollars a month plus carte blanche access to your business center, that means you can't kick me out after midnight!<br /><br />Jake: Business center?<br /><br />Amir: Hello? Hello? Mm. Locked down another apartment dude.<br /><br />Jake: I don't think you did.<br /><br />Amir: Moving is tough though, my current place is kind of a dump.<br /><br />Jake: Where is it?<br /><br />Amir: It's the dump. <br /><br />Jake: Oh, god that's sad.<br /><br />Amir (Now on the phone again): Hello! Yes, Village Realty. Long time listener, second time caller: and I'm baller!  Heh. Oscar the Grouch here speaking and I can say that 'cause I live in a fucking trash can. <br /><br />Jake: You know what, I'm on the site right now, you can't afford any of these apartments. <br /><br />Amir: I'm looking at one listing which is particularly cherry. Though on the contrary, it might be an apple, because it is that of my eye!<br /><br />Jake: Bad.<br /><br />Amir: I'm speaking of course of your seven bedroom quadplex overlooking Central Park West, asking price 38.9 million dollars, so let me do you one worse. Five dollars a month plus carte blanche access to your business center.<br /><br />Jake: Drop the business center.<br /><br />Amir: Yes, that is a very lowball offer, but if I'm doing my math correctly-<br /><br />Jake: I guarantee you, you're not.<br /><br />Amir: You are still netting a cool 1.9 million dollars in commission. Which may not seem like a lot to you but I live in a god damn trash heap so try not to rub it in my face. I already do that enough as is. <br /><br />Jake: Hang up.<br /><br />Amir (Speaking to Jake): Good call, power move. (Speaking to the phone) I'm going to hang up on you right now and you better call me back with a three letter answer: Nah.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you live in a trash heap?<br /><br />Amir: My last landlord was a coward and a thief. AKA: Me. That's right, you're looking at a modern day robin hood, I steal from the bitch and give to the whore. <br /><br />Jake: I have no idea what you're saying. Ever.<br /><br />Amir: Neither do I. Alls I know is that I can't afford first and last month, or any of the ones in between. Uh oh, I am blowing up.<br /><br />Jake: Great.<br /><br />Amir: Yellow is the color of my energy, hello?<br /><br />Jake: Old song.<br /><br />Amir (Speaking to Jake): They have a studio in Hell's Kitchen for nine seventy five a month.<br /><br />Jake: Take it.<br /><br />Amir (On the phone.): Go fuck yourself. I'LL TAKE IT. Hello? They hung up. They hung up on me.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah but they hung up when you said go fuck yourself to them.  Don't you have anybody that you can live with?<br /><br />Amir: Oh, good call. (Dialing phone) Hey wanna do mimosas after work?<br /><br />Jake: No, I don't. Hey, no don't do that. Don't shoehorn that in then act like I said yes.<br /><br />Amir: We're on. Mickey my friend!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Amir: I have a proposition for you Mickey. Yes, how would you like a new roommate my friend. That's right. That's right I am quiet, I am clean, and just between you and me, I bake a mean frittata.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you want to keep that a secret just between you two?<br /><br />Amir: How does 4,900 dollars a month sound Mickey? That's right, that's first, last, and security Mickey. We can finally start that organic garden Mickey. That's right, just me you and some fresh basil, just the way we always wanted Mickey. Alright excellent Mickey, that sounds great. That sounds great Mickey, come outside. Come outside and help me carry in this boxspring Mickey it looks heavier than it is Mickey. Are you outside, are you coming outside Mickey? <br /><br />Jake: Why do you say his name this much?<br /><br />Amir: You know why I'm not there Mickey?  Because I'm not coming. I'm not gonna be your roommate Mickey. I live in a god damn trash heap and your rent was too damn high. Your mom's bringing us iced tea in mason jars?  Well that doesn't sound like my dream! That doesn't sound like my idea of a good time Mickey. Hold on, I'm getting another call.<br /><br />Jake: Make your phone calls in the conference room from now on.<br /><br />Amir: Oscar the Grouch speaking. That's fine! That's fine I will vacate your trash heap at ten P.M. because you know why? I'll be looking down at that trash heap from Central Park fricken west for five dollars a month in a fricken business center!<br /><br />",

What are you talking about? You think Green Eggs and Ham is better than the freaking Giving Tree?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm saying they're both kid's authors.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh well I'm saying it's not a freaking contest. Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio were both baseball players.<br /><br />AMIR: Both great, yea very similar baseball players. <br /><br />CHERYL: I don't know...<br /><br />JAKE: Yea but which one's bett- you know what that was a weird comparison.  <br /><br />CHERYL: Let's do it, let's do this revenge fudge.

(To Amir) What are you even doing here?<br /><br />Amir: I'm Murph's butler!<br /><br />Jake: Since when?<br /><br />Amir: Since I've never not been Murph's butler. My dad was his dad's butler and they had a suicide pact and at the last second my dad <br /><br />chickened out and frikkin moved! Yeah! Ever since then I've been paying off his life debt. Throwing this on ice.<br /><br />Jake: Is this still a date? That's still happening, right?

I'll be back here in a tucked in express button up before <br /><br />you even know what's up. (Doorbell rings) Neko the devil! God hates swag and she's here to meet her maker!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Murph: Get the door, dumbass.<br /><br />Jake: How do I look?<br /><br />Emily: Really handsome. I would eat your asshole.<br /><br />Jake: All I heard was handsome, okay?<br /><br />(Jake opens the door for Neko)<br /><br />Jake: Hey! You must be Neko. I'm Jake. Um... I just met you, (holds up a can of gravy) and this is gravy!<br /><br />(Neko ignores him)<br /><br />Jake: (Partially subvocalizing) Fuck! What are you doing?!<br /><br />(Neko sits on a couch next to Emily)<br /><br />Emily: Oh my god, you are so Asian. Okay, be honest. Are these real? (Emily feels Neko's tits) Oh my god, you're a fucking liar if you <br /><br />say they're real. I feel like I'm in the fucking Silicon Valley, you fucking bitch. I love your tits.<br /><br />Jake: (Still talking to himself by the door) You went to a bodega and got gravy, for this. You're the weakest link.<br /><br />Emily: They're the same fucking size, are you fucking kidding me? These are fucking fake tits! These are the fakest tits I've ever <br /><br />felt! God, they feel good. I'm gonna make Murph buy me these.<br /><br />(Jake is back in the room where Murph was working out, and Murph runs in half-dressed with blood on his hand)<br /><br />Murph: Time! Time! What's my time?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah man it was really quick, but you obviously didn't finish showering. Can't imagine you shit.<br /><br />Murph: I shit in the shower and I tried to smoosh it down the drain. Got everywhere.<br /><br />Jake: You call this getting ready?<br /><br />Murph: As ready as I'll ever be.<br /><br />(Murph holds up a wedding ring)<br /><br />Jake: Holy shit dude, you're proposing!

How about this, if you try to leave, I'll kick you in the back!<br /><br />Jake: Easy does it. Easy does it.<br /><br />Amir: (Carrying a tray of sliders) Alright, appetizer time! We're talking pulled pork sliders with a honey dijon glaze.<br /><br />Jake: Red wine coulda worked with that, right?<br /><br />Murph: Yo, you ever taken a picture of your dick next to a slider and told the girl it was a full on burger?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Emily: Yes.<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Murph: (Handing Jake his phone) Check it.<br /><br />Jake: Yikes man, a lot smaller than the slider.<br /><br />Murph: Hah, it's like a... pff... wrong picture so it's like that's a triple quarter pounder or er...

Amir finishes distributing the meals.]<br /><br />AMIR: Welcome, hello, bruchim habaim, and bon giorno, to a culinary experience from all around; our globe... Carpe diem! Seize the fish. Heh! No, tonight we're having carp.<br /><br />MURPH: Nice.<br /><br />AMIR: [imitating a record scratching] Wrickee wrickee-- scratch that. We are having branzino.<br /><br />EMILY: Neko's a vegan. She BBM'd me.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, um... uh, she can have the... bed of arugula-- like, I don't know what to do at this point; I'm sorry.<br /><br />MURPH: It's okay, but-- hey, Jake, uh, if your date had dietary restrictions, you really should have emailed us ahead of time. That would've been polite.<br /><br />JAKE: I--... just met her, so I wouldn't know anything about her dietary restrictions, right?<br /><br />MURPH: Well, you just threw him a curveball that he can't hit, and I kind of need tonight to go perfectlyyyyyyyyyy...<br /><br />[Murph holds his hands up, his right between Emily and his left, so only Jake can see the ring he's already wearing.]<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Okay, I saw it, put it away...<br /><br />[Murph holds his right hand closer to Emily, she kisses his palm, and he lowers his hands again.]<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Good save.<br /><br />AMIR: Uh... it's fine. It's fine. Neko, um, do you eat beef? Or, do you not, because you're a fucking vegan now, all of a sudden-- I can't-- I'm sorry.<br /><br />[Amir walks off. Murph gets up to follow him, and shoots Jake a look of disappointment.]<br /><br />JAKE: That's not on me, right? ...Buddy? Okay.<br /><br />[Murph goes to talk to Amir just outside the dining room. Amir is chugging a glass of pinot grigio.]<br /><br />MURPH: Hey, c'mon, c'mon. Easy on the grig', easy on the grig'.<br /><br />AMIR: [ranting rapidly, barely retaining any semblance of composure] I just can't believe she fucking did that to me like that. And in the middle of a fucking meal? What kind of timing is that?<br /><br />MURPH: I know. It's Jake's fault. It's Jake's fault. He raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, he raw-dogged me, h-- I feel like he bent me over a table and dogged me raw or something. He raw-dogged me! Yeah.<br /><br />MURPH: That's exactly what he did. He just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, and he did it raw! That's the worst part. I feel like if he lubed me up-- okay, fine. That's one thing. Whatever. Moist: it slides right in-- Yeah! Just spit. [makes a spitting noise] Slides right in, slides right out; it doesn't hurt that much. But for him-- for him to raw-dog us like that?<br /><br />MURPH: [simultaneously] Alright. Right; spit-- just spit on it. That's all I'm asking. Just spit-- just one. Right. That's fine.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey-- you guys know I can hear you, right? This was not my fault--<br /><br />MURPH: It was his fault!<br /><br />AMIR: It was.<br /><br />MURPH: But you're ready for this, okay? You can handle it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />[Murph pats Amir on the shoulder.]<br /><br />MURPH: Go!<br /><br />[Back in the dining room, Emily is staring at Jake and sensually licking a piece of fish she's holding with her bare hands.]<br /><br />JAKE: You know, that's not hot. Your hands probably smell like fish now.<br /><br />MURPH: [returning to the table with Amir] Whoa ho ho! Nobody touch their dinner until I post this to Pinterest. This is the most pinteresting thing I've seen all week. [he leans over Jake's shoulder] Jake, you're gonna re-pin that, right?<br /><br />JAKE: I'd have to sign up for an account.<br /><br />MURPH: Good, so you'll do that?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah. You know what? When I go home tonight, I'll sign up for an account.<br /><br />MURPH: I'd feel much more comfortable if you'd just do it now.<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Not this second, okay?<br /><br />MURPH: [whispering] Jake, don't fuckin' embarrass me at my house, dude.<br /><br />[Jake grabs his iPhone.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's not gonna let me do it from my phone.<br /><br />MURPH: Here.<br /><br />[Murph procures a green iPad from somewhere, and hands it to Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: This is insane, that you're making me do this.<br /><br />MURPH: Don't talk to me.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. I'm on Pinterest. Here, just re-pinned it.<br /><br />EMILY: Babe, make sure that he pins some other stuff. Otherwise it'll look like a dummy account.<br /><br />MURPH: She's right... Fuck it, let's browse!<br /><br />JAKE: Fuck what? Dinner? The date?<br /><br />EMILY: Babe, make sure that he shows his feminine side but also his masculine pride.<br /><br />MURPH: Ya gots to! Yo, that kale smoothie looks dope.<br /><br />JAKE: Are we still on a date? Is this even still a date? Because I'd feel like I was missing out if Neko had said anything to me, ever! Neko! ...Neko! Come on.<br /><br />AMIR: All right! So, this is a most interesting little dish; it's sort of a palate-cleanser in terms that it's a spinach hazelnut salad with onions, olives, and a citrus balsamic vinaigrette.<br /><br />[As Amir describes the salad, Emily smiles slyly and runs her foot up Jake's leg under the table. Jake shakes his head, but Emily nods back. Jake points at Murph, who's still standing over his shoulder, and mouths He's your boyfriend, then pushes her foot back down away from him.]<br /><br />AMIR: I know what you're thinking: Salad in between the meals? Well, we sort of had a... special little customer who needed a special little salad, so here we are.<br /><br />EMILY: Neko's allergic to nuts. [kicks Jake under the table]<br /><br />AMIR: Is she! Okay, Neko, how 'bout this? How 'bout you [Amir begins furiously dismantling the salad with his hands, throwing hazelnuts onto the floor] eat, around, the, nuts? How 'bout that, Neko? Huh? ...Sorry, it--<br /><br />MURPH: Hey hey, focus up, I need your feedback on this pin: pink aztec dress, or cupcake kebabs?

Murph spins the empty wine bottle, and it points to Emily.]<br /><br />MURPH: Call me Sonny Bono-- not because I died in a horrific ski accident-- but because... [singing] I got you, babe!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow. ...Mean joke.<br /><br />[Murph and Emily make out for a very long time. Emily stares at Jake the whole time. So does Murph. Jake looks freaked out.]<br /><br />EMILY: Mmmm, mmmm-- oh, that was a good one. Add it to our kiss Twitter, babe.<br /><br />MURPH: Yeah! Hashtag open mouth, hashtag amazing, hashtag she was lookin' at Jake the whole time...<br /><br />EMILY: My turn!<br /><br />[Emily grabs the bottle, forcefully turns it toward Jake, and pokes him with it.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...I'm down for a peck, but, uh... only if it's cool with Neko!<br /><br />[Jake and Emily lean over the table toward each other. Emily grabs Jake's face and holds him there as she makes out with him.]<br /><br />EMILY: [muffled by Jake's face] God, that feels right...<br /><br />[Murph stares at them. Eventually Jake breaks free.]<br /><br />JAKE: Get off me, you wench! Neko, you just witnessed an assault.<br /><br />MURPH: It's your turn, Jake.

And they were pretty convenient when you were tonguing my soulmate, AKA my future wife!<br /><br />[Murph holds up his hand out of Emily's view again, showing Jake the ring.]<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Dude, take that off.

Lemon sorbet with a chocolate mousse.<br /><br />EMILY: Cold food hurts Neko's teeth.<br /><br />AMIR: Of fucking course.<br /><br />[Jake and Murph talk on the balcony.]<br /><br />JAKE: Look, man, Emily is not the right girl. Alright? I don't know if Emily is into me, or if she's just... generally insane, but... I-- I just-- I just-- I don't think you can propose to her. Okay?<br /><br />MURPH: ...Yeah, man.<br /><br />JAKE: [calming down] I-- I mean, this night has been... insane!<br /><br />MURPH: It's-- It's been crazy...<br /><br />JAKE: Right?<br /><br />MURPH: It's nuts.<br /><br />JAKE: I think we're gonna be better friends for it, though.

Amir enters, sits at his desk, clears his throat and unrolls a scroll]<br /><br />Jake: Not another scroll dude <br /><br />Amir: Top 10 first date ideas: by Jacob-<br /><br />Jake: No!<br /><br />Amir: Penn Cooper-<br /><br />Jake: No!<br /><br />Amir: Hurwitz<br /><br />Jake: No! Use your own name!<br /><br />Amir: Number 10 <br /><br />Jake: You sick fuck! Use you own name!<br /><br />Amir: Where and when. Let it be her call, it is 2011 after all<br /><br />Jake: It's actually 2012 and right off the bat first up on your top 10 date ideas is sort of a cop out so you don't have to choose one <br /><br />Amir: Number 9: feeling wine! laughs<br /><br />Jake: Not that good of a joke <br /><br />Amir: Take her to a wine bar; and not a place that's close, go real far; and not in a plane, drive in a car. That's right, go to wine country - Napa Valley, California together. <br /><br />Jake: Great! <br /><br />[While Jake is talking, Amir plays peekaboo behind the scroll]<br /><br />Jake: So on your first date you want to take a cross-country drive with a stranger and then spend several days in wine country with them? That's like a nine day excursion buddy- <br /><br />[Amir still peeks from behind the scroll, this time wearing sunglasses]<br /><br />Jake: Stop doing that!<br /><br />Amir: Number 8: Take your mother on a date. The first chick you were inside of and you didn't even call her. Now that's baller. <br /><br />Jake: That's disgusting <br /><br />Amir: Lucky number sleven: change your name to Kevin! <br /><br />Jake: Weird. Not a date<br /><br />Amir: Meet her in heaven. That's right a Romeo and Juliet group suicide so you could spend all of eternity together. <br /><br />Jake: Why do you write everything on these scrolls? Like these ancient treasure maps you seem to have? <br /><br />Amir: Six: stands for chicks. That's right, it's the year 2000, so wherever she wants to go you make it happen, Cap'n. <br /><br />Jake: That is the second time you've: 1) gotten the year wrong, and 2) avoided choosing a date spot <br /><br />Amir: High five: smoke a bowl and roll. Wake and bake and make her make you a steak. You're ingesting weed and ecstasy, and guess what day it is... X-mas eve.<br /><br />Jake: Have you done that before? <br /><br />Amir: Yes! Number 4 is a city so nice they named it Rice. Rice, Texas. <br /><br />Jake: Another road trip?<br /><br />Amir: You actually fly in through Dallas! It's a hub!<br /><br />Jake: Fine.<br /><br />Amir: Number 3: will you marry me? <br /><br />Jake: Too much, too fast, way too soon! <br /><br />Amir: I don't need an answer tonight, but I do need a promise in writing that you'll love me forever. <br /><br />Jake: That's more than an answer. That's a contract. <br /><br />Amir: All marriages are arranged, if you include destiny. <br /><br />Jake: I don't <br /><br />Amir: Number 2: Darlin' it's always been you. Please say I do, I have a rabbi a priest and a mosque on standby. <br /><br />Jake: That last one is not a person. By the way, these are all still first date suggestions, right? <br /><br />Amir: Honestly, I'm just trying to get laid. <br /><br />Jake: Bad way <br /><br />Amir: Number 1: you are the one <br /><br />Jake: Okay <br /><br />Amir: I'm down on one knee and this is my plea. You are the prettiest girl that I ever did see. So you ask that Lady: Will you marry me?<br /><br />[Both stay silent as Amir rolls up the scroll]<br /><br />Amir: Well?<br /><br />Jake: Well what?<br /><br />Amir: Well, thoughts on the list? <br /><br />Jake: Why do you do this? Why do you stay up at night in your apartment making these weird lists? And you know what, even if you get some kind of perverse pleasure out of writing the lists, why bring them to work, and read them to me, when I don't like it? <br /><br />Amir: Great, so a simple yes or no would have sufficed. <br /><br />Jake: It actually wouldn't have sufficed, because you said: Thought's on the list? That's not a yes or no question<br /><br />Amir: And? What are your thoughts on the list? <br /><br />Jake: It's a bad list. It's a bad list and you're a bad person. <br /><br />Amir: Wow! That was scoff unexpected... I honestly thought you loved it.<br /><br />",

Paul is standing up, talking to them. Amir is standing and wearing a denim vest.)<br /><br />Paul: Hey everybody, thanks for coming today. Uh, the reason I wanted to have this all-hands meeting is because that there are a lot of new faces at the company, and I thought this would be a good chance to get to know each other. So why don't we go around the room, everybody say your name, what you do, and maaaybe a fun fact about yourself. I'll start.

Are you... C'mon.<br /><br />(Paul walks out of the room, several others follow him.)<br /><br />Jake: I'm a writer here--<br /><br />Amir: You're more than that. You're a generous man, you're a kind soul, and you're engaged. A family man, everyone.<br /><br />Jake: Paul just said to say what we do with the company.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, Paul also said that his favorite movie was Con Air but nobody called him out on that!<br /><br />Jake: You did!

I once shot 3 holes in one in a row it wasn't an accident either, the killing.<br /><br />Julie: You monster.<br /><br />Amir: I am a monster. On the golf course I take no prisoners. Also I will never un-see that child's face. Every blink is a reminder and every time my eyes aren't open she's just in my minds eye, taunting me. (Makes a scary face). Bleh.<br /><br />Michael: How could you do that?<br /><br />Amir: How could you do that? Crystal Skull? We saw that, it was garbage! I killed a child?

To me, the crowd... <br /><br />JAKE: Give me the milk!<br /><br />BEN: Ok guys, if I give you the milk you gotta swear to me not to... <br /><br />AMIR: Just give him the milk!<br /><br />BEN: Ok fine. I know how to do this, induce vomiting, I can do this. But I need your permission, ok?<br /><br />AMIR: Sure.<br /><br />BEN: I'm gonna warn you, it's not by the bewks. <br /><br />AMIR: By the what?<br /><br />BEN: Not by the bewks.  <br /><br />AMIR: It's by the what?<br /><br />BEN: Not by the bewww-ks. <br /><br />AMIR: What is it by?<br /><br />JAKE: He's trying to say book. <br /><br />BEN: Shut up idiot!

Ok this is insane, they say to just punch you in the stomach. <br /><br />BEN: Do it! <br /><br />Jake punches Amir in the stomach. A shoe flies out, and Jake catches it. <br /><br />JAKE: A shoe? <br /><br />AMIR: That actually makes sense... because literally a second before I started complaining of pain, I ate a shoe.   <br /><br />BEN: I saved the day again. <br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't, you didn't do anything except give him expired milk and stab him with a straw. <br /><br />BEN: You're welcome. <br /><br />JAKE: 911 is the real hero.

MMMMPH!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ dude, what happened?<br /><br />Amir: (Singing) I had a bad day, I took-a one down, I sang a sad song just to turn it around...<br /><br />Jake: Does this have anything to do with the 319 Emails I got when I got off the subway?<br /><br />Amir: It's kinda hard to be sure, I was too busy being BOUND AND GAGGED FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES ON ACCOUNT OF ALL THE EMAILS I SENT!<br /><br />Jake: So it's not that hard to be sure, right? First email from you came 49 minutes ago. Anybody want half a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich? I tried to finish it but could nay get 'er done. I'm full as a kite and I just might stop to eat you out.<br /><br />Amir:... EMAIL OF THE FUCKING YEAR.<br /><br />Jake: Not really. You respond to your email Here ye, here ye, did anybody hear me? This is an amazing deal, get it while she's NOT. Kevin responds I'll eat the sandwich if you shut the fuck up. And you respond to that I'll shut up if literally everybody in the company tells me to... Gangam Style.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, exactly, it's a Korean pop song.<br /><br />Jake: I know.<br /><br />Amir: And guess what Kevin got in response? A heaping helpful of radio silence.<br /><br />Jake: 211 emails in 30 seconds, which means a bunch of people told you to shut up twice.<br /><br />Amir: They didn't have to tell me twice.<br /><br />Jake: They actually did, because you respond Yeehaw, partners! Didn't realize y'all hated me so much. Owie Zowie. But, not everyone told me to shut up twice, therefore the email thread, unlike Murph's grandmother, lives.<br /><br />Amir: Low blow? HELL NO!<br /><br />Jake: Hell yes. I guess people stopped responding to the thread and started talking to you in person, because your next email says, I've had it up to here with people coming by my desk and being mean to me.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: I don't know why you guys have this mob mentality, but you sheep need to learn how to think individually.<br /><br />Amir: BAH, BAA! And guess what happened next... my neck was stapled!<br /><br />Jake: Yep, saw that. Your next email, Who's the coward bitch that stapled my neck? I blinked for a second and I missed you, missed you, now I gotta kissed you. Make yourself known. Rosie responds It was me. and I guess you had to retaliate in some way, because your next email is Who's the prick that threw that brick at my head when I went to hit Rosie? Be a man and fess up to the crime so that I can do the time. Owen Parsons responds It was me. And you reply, 9 minutes later, Who's the loser who tripped me when I went to staple Owen's neck? I tripped and almost hit my head really hard, that would've been a lawsuit for sure.<br /><br />Amir: WORST. DAY. EVER.<br /><br />Jake: Yes, I imagine it was, because you sent out another email. (Amir is shown eating his sandwich.) I was just hit with another fucking brick. Are you shitting me with these? That makes 3 bricks on the gay. I don't know where you guys even got these things or the audacity to hurl them at me at such close range-- are you not full anymore?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah. <br /><br />Jake: Why are you still typing these emails?<br /><br />Amir: I wanted to diffuse the situation!<br /><br />Jake: You think this is diffusing the situation? Y'all are gonna have to bind and gag me if you want peace and quiet around here. And good luck, because I'm got going quietly. Your last email, sent 30 seconds before I got here, is obviously typed with your face, it's just MMPHUSFISDMPH. And then somehow, in perfect english, Gangam style.<br /><br />Amir: That's my email signature!}<br /><br />Josh: Why did you ungag him?!<br /><br />Jake: C'mon dude, hasn't he suffered enough?<br /><br />(Amir's neck is stapled.)<br /><br />Amir: Oh, he got me again! The prick hit me again! Did ya see that, with the stapler?!<br /><br />(A brick is thrown)<br /><br />Jake: Ok, they're throwing bricks.<br /><br />Amir: Get out of here, save yourself, I can take it!

Don't take matters like that into your own hands.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, no more bomb threats, Adolf.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you take off that costume? OK? I don't want people to think we coordinated this.<br /><br />AMIR: (snorts) You know, in some weird, fucked up, twisted way, I'd actually be happy if people thought that.<br /><br />JAKE: I know.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm serious. (snorts) In my messed up mind, like I can delude myself into thinking that you called me in a mustard costume and asked me to wear this.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I mean, I guess so.<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, if you want to know the whole truth, I saw a doctor this weekend, a psychotherapist specializing in manic depression and acute schizophrenia, and, uh, he I guess diagnosed me, for lack of a better term, with having these delusions of grandeur and, uh, made it quite abundantly clear to me that, without medication, that you just got punked, bitch!

Okay, it was offensive.<br /><br />AMIR: You know, in some states, the presidential race is a foregone conclusion, so New York and Alabama, thanks but no thanks, you don't need to vote.<br /><br />JAKE: What if everybody thought like that?<br /><br />AMIR: Then I'd be a genius. Okay, convincing an entire state not to vote? I should be president.<br /><br />JAKE: A president wouldn't do that. (Amir makes face) Oh, worst face you've ever made.<br /><br />AMIR: Barack Obama? More like Yitzchak Osama. Okay, that guy's a Jew and an Arab and you mean to tell me religion has no part in this election? (Jake leaves) Where are you going? Afraid of the truth?<br /><br />AMIR: Mitten Romney? I'm smitten, Homney. <br /><br />JAKE: That's not good, man, homney's not a word.<br /><br />AMIR: And Paul Ryan, we are tryin', but nobody's Biden their time quite like our vice president, Joseph Dan Quayle.<br /><br />JAKE: You're not smart.<br /><br />AMIR: Never said I was.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, I know it's a two-party system, but what about the candidate nobody's talking about, Mitt Romney.<br /><br />JAKE: People are talking about Mitt Romney. You were just talking about Mitt Romney.<br /><br />AMIR: When?<br /><br />JAKE: Remember Smitten Homney?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, yeah that was funny.<br /><br />JAKE: It was not funny.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, we know you're busy, but you gotta find-<br /><br />AMIR: Voting isn't hip, but you know what is? A rap, so give me a beat. (rapping) Politics is a polish-dick so cast your vote on this pink (censored)<br /><br />JAKE: Stop, stop!<br /><br />AMIR: Censorer! I sense you're a censorer, sir, who censored my words, so rest assured I'm incensed, for sure!<br /><br />JAKE: No more slam poetry. Okay, that was really good but no more slap poetry.<br /><br />AMIR: Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta be as well-informed as possible, so research your candidates before you head to the polls.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right, so, for example, Barack Hossein Osama, wow, yeah, he stands for socialism, and Mitt Mone-y, ha ha, he stands... for socialism.<br /><br />JAKE: So get out there and cast your vote for your candidate todate- today. Today-<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my God, let me bail you out, brother, so get out there and vote for your favorite candidate today.

Okay, ready? Three, two, one. Get out there and vote. Blululehh. Let me take it slow and we can speed it up.<br /><br />JAKE: Even if you were blinking before, that's fine. <br /><br />AMIR: (more slowly, enunciating) So get out there and vote for your favorite candiday-diday. <br /><br />(Amir turns around and broods, refusing Jake's hand on his back)<br /><br />(Amir is still facing backwards)<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, let's try one m-<br /><br />AMIR: Don't! I said I needed two minutes.<br /><br />JAKE: And you've been standing there for, like, seven!<br /><br />AMIR: Candidate.

I'm sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: That's okay. Yeah, yeah, I needed that. <br /><br />JAKE: Candidate.<br /><br />AMIR: I feel like I got it now. Get out there and vote for your favorite candidaydiday. When you hit me, something messed me up, man.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, so if you're over the age of 18-<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, I'm in college, I didn't register, I can't vote. Wrong!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, if they didn't register then you actually can't vote.<br /><br />AMIR: (raising mug of tea) That sounds like Tea Party philosophy to me. (dumps tea on Jake)<br /><br />JAKE: That was hot tea!<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

Who wants 5 liters of piping-hot split pea soup? Or, should I say, shit pee poop? *laughs* No, I'm just jok-oh no! Ah! *falls over, pours soup on face* ARGH! FUCK, IT'S BOILING!<br /><br />Jake: O-oh my god!<br /><br />Amir: AH, IT'S BOILING MY FACE AND NECK! AAH, IT'S SO HOT! AAH!<br /><br />Jake: Hey, alright, I'm going to call 9-1-1, okay?<br /><br />Amir: No, it's not going to do anything! I prank call them all the time!<br /><br />Jake: I'll call it from my phone.<br /><br />Amir: I do it from your phone!<br /><br />Jake: Well, I'll just tell them you legitimately burned your face this time!<br /><br />Amir: I crank-yanked them last night with that exact line! I said, please come, I legitimately burned my face this time! They show up, there's a flaming pile of dog shit on my own apartment stoop. Got 'em good.<br /><br />Jake: ..did you?<br /><br />Amir: Nah, not really. They just left and a huge part of my apartment burned down. Can you do me a favor?<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: I'd like to stay with you in order to recoup from this injury. I need you to be my nurse for a week.<br /><br />Jake: ...no.<br /><br />Amir: What? You already said yes! How could you take it back now?<br /><br />Jake: No, I didn't. I said what.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, what is yes! Why would you want to know what the favor is unless you were going to do it?<br /><br />Jake: To see if I wanted to agree to the favor!<br /><br />Amir: No! Hell no!<br /><br />Jake: Don't tell me what I mean.<br /><br />Amir: This is unreal! This was your soup!<br /><br />Jake: What are you talking about?<br /><br />Amir: I made this soup for you, right? I called you last night and I said, if I brought in leftover split pea soup, would you have some?<br /><br />Jake: And I said no!<br /><br />Amir: Exactly! And then I said, if you're not going to have it, then I'm just not going to bring any in, and you said fine.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, fine as in don't bring in the soup.<br /><br />Amir: No, fine as in yes!<br /><br />Jake: Stop telling me what I mean by shit!<br /><br />Amir: Are you actually yelling at me right now? I feel like I'm being burnt alive in a cauldron, or a bowl of hot soup was dumped on my face.<br /><br />Jake: Have you already forgotten that that is what happened?<br /><br />Amir: *sigh* I'm starting to regret this whole plan.<br /><br />Jake: What plan, man?<br /><br />Amir: I figured if I scalded myself on my most important organ,  my face...<br /><br />Jake: Wrong.<br /><br />Amir: For most people it's heart, for me, it's face.<br /><br />Jake: You're wrong. Go on.<br /><br />Amir: I figured if I doused myself in hot soup, you'd want to bring me in. Show me some tender love and care, y'know? Maybe rent some DVDs from Blockbuster Media. I would even eat some leftover yams that you would offer me. I don't really like yams, but I wouldn't have the heart to tell you.<br /><br />Jake: Well, I'm well aware that you hate yams.<br /><br />Amir: I hate 'em. I hate yams!<br /><br />Jake: Stop saying yams.<br /><br />Amir: ....YAMS.<br /><br />Jake: Look, if you really did this just to recover at my house, if you're that pathetic, lowly, and masochistic, then...y'know what? I almost do feel bad enough to have you...<br /><br />Amir: No, no, I don't want to do it like this. I don't want that pity invite!<br /><br />Jake: What are you talking about? Yes you do! You poured the soup on your face!<br /><br />Amir: This isn't about me.<br /><br />Jake: Yes, it is! Everything's about you! You're the most selfish person I know!<br /><br />Amir: That is not fair.<br /><br />Jake: Unfair? You prank called 9-1-1! You took emergency responders away from people who actually need it!<br /><br />Amir: Okay, y'know what? I accept the pity offer. You've made me feel like shit, and so I will accept the pity offer, but I will NOT eat the yams.<br /><br />Jake: Oh, you'll eat the yams.<br /><br />Amir: I will not eat the yams, Amir!<br /><br />Jake: I'M Jake, YOU'RE Amir.<br /><br />Amir: ...YAMS.<br /><br />Jake: *starts strangling AmirAmir: Aah, god, this isn't part of the yam plan!

Your fault. My pants are too tight, and that ain't right.<br /><br />AMIR: I agree. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't respond to your text messages as to whether or not you should buy those pants, but I was with my mom.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, I can't wait to hear this story.  I'm all beers.<br /><br />(Jake mimics opening a beer, drinking it with glug sounds , taking some breaths, drinking again - with more glug sounds - crushing the empty beer can on his forehead and tossing it away.  Jake then laughs at his own joke)<br /><br />AMIR: My mom was in a car accident and so my entire family was with her in the hospital.<br /><br />JAKE: Are you done being a jackass?<br /><br />AMIR: Look, I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say.<br /><br />JAKE: No, no, I'm sorry. Jesus. I'm sorry. <br /><br />AMIR: Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: What a tragedy.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's just so weird to see this - <br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, no, I can't believe a modern hospital wouldn't have cell phone service. I - I - I - I - I - I'm appalled.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh? No, it had cell phone service.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, it HAD cell phone service.  But you didn't respond to my text, so, your lies are catching up with you, Blumenfeld.  Hmm, I don't know.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I had cell phone reception, I jus-<br /><br />JAKE: How you gonna play this one, bud?<br /><br />AMIR: I just couldn't respond, okay, because I was-<br /><br />JAKE: Cuz you were busy operating on her?  Cuz you're a PA or some shit? Are you a physician's assistant?  Or were you in the waiting room with your dick in your hand?<br /><br />AMIR: I was in the waiting room, yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Then you had your dick in your hand, didn't you?<br /><br />AMIR: No, I didn't have my dick in my - <br /><br />JAKE: You were jerkin' your gerkin in the waiting room. <br /><br />AMIR: No, I was not.<br /><br />JAKE: I bet a doctor would frown upon that.  I do.<br /><br />AMIR: I was on my phone, okay? I was starting this phone tree, you know, trying to alert every member of my family as to what happened.<br /><br />JAKE: You have got to be SHITTING me with that, dude!  You were on your phone? You were on your phone??  And you were ignoring my texts as they're coming in??  By the way, a phone tree works like this: You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know what to say.  I guess I got punked.  It's just that I'm also in emotional pain, too, right now, man.<br /><br />JAKE:  Don't play that card, you coward.  Okay, I sent you 12 pictures of myself in a dressing room, and it would've taken 3 seconds out of your day to give me a hell to the no. You know, even, going forward, how about if you ignore my texts, I'll know, don't buy the cords.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, I ignored the text.<br /><br />JAKE:  Going forward, I said.  As in starting now, and seeing as though I texted you yesterday, Lucy! You got some 'splaining to do!  (to the office) If anybody heard that and didn't laugh, I urge you to reconsider.  Okay, I would take a pity laugh to save some face.  Speaking of face, why is nobody sucking on my face as I am looking amazing in these ill-fitting - slim-fitting! - cords?<br /><br />AMIR: I thought you said you didn't like the pants.<br /><br />JAKE: You thought wrong.  A pair of roys for this lazy goy make the Jewish sluts say oy oy oy.<br /><br />AMIR: Offensive.<br /><br />JAKE: I butt-fucked my brother, on a booze cruise!<br /><br />AMIR: Can't you just return the corduroys? <br /><br />JAKE: Of course I could. It's not exactly how I went to spend my Sunday afternoon, right, bud?<br /><br />(Amir's cell phone rings)<br /><br />AMIR:  The hospital's calling me.<br /><br />JAKE: And once again, you choose them over me.<br /><br />AMIR: I haven't picked it up yet.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, but I know you're thinking about it, dude.  And tell you what, if you pick that up, (in a bit of an accent) me and you are done professionally.  (to the office) Another joke for everybody, that's Christian Ball [sic], (to Amir) but really? Pick it up, and we're not friends.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. (to phone) Hey, can I call you back? (Amir hangs up)<br /><br />(Jake gives Amir a look.  Amir gives him a look back.) <br /><br />JAKE: Oh - oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah, that doesn't matter at all.  You still picked it up!<br /><br />AMIR: I hung up on them!<br /><br />JAKE: You c- you certainly did not.  You left this conversation, you had another one! Ok?  How do you think that makes me feel?<br /><br />AMIR: I told them I'd call them back!<br /><br />JAKE: You s- you uh ew ah - please! You answered the phone, you said (in a high voice, but not in an imitation of Amir's high voice) Hi, how are you? I'm Amir Blumenfeld, I'm a piece of shit. <br /><br />AMIR: No!<br /><br />JAKE: Then you said, (again, in a high voice) can I please call you back? Let me please call you back?  I bet you do call them back, too!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I might.  Probably, yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, man, alright, we have to figure this shit out, ok? I'm sorry your mom's dead, but that's not - <br /><br />AMIR:  She's not dead.<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta be SHITTING me with that!<br /><br />",

Shoot &#39;er! Shoot the bitch for all I care!&#39; Meanwhile, she&#39;s out there attacking people, almost as if you trained her to do it.

That's a spoiler?<br /><br />AMIR: (Laughing) Yes! That's a spoiler. To say, that's insane it spoils the experience.<br /><br />JAKE: Something insane happens every single week!<br /><br />AMIR: I know, but now I feel like someone's going to die or something.<br /><br />JAKE: Maybe- Someone dies a lot.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my god!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not saying they did.

I asked you for a bite of your sandwich? Oh no, I asked you for a bite!<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) Okay? I'm serious. No, it wasn't just that. You said, Can I have a bite, Daddy? You called yourself Daddy.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, daddy. It's a joke. It's a joking nickname. <br /><br />JAKE: No, it's not a joke. It makes me feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />AMIR: On my god. You are reading so much into it. <br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) I'm not- Look, don't worry. We don't have to have this conservation. I'm just saying. <br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) Okay. Can I have a bite, bro? Can I have a bite, cuz? Can I have a bite, aunt? Can I have a bite, uncle? Can I have a bite, nephew?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, no. All of those are examples of things that are unacceptable, actually. <br /><br />AMIR: UNACCEPTABLE?! To say bro? Are you kidding me? Everyone calls each other that!<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Bro may be the one that works. But calling yourself my aunt?<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) Stop. It doesn't. I don't need a list. All I'm saying. It doesn't have to be. Don't make it a thing. Don't make it a thing. Why are you getting so angry? Why are you harping on it like this? I'm just asking you not to call yourself daddy.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) Bro is fine, okay. So we're on the same generational level. So why don't I give you a list? I'll give you a family tree and you give me a pre-approved list of what I can call you and what I cannot. Daddy: X. Mommy: X. Bro: Okay, that's fine. Cuz: That's fine. So everything on my generational level is fine.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm angry? You're about to leave!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I'm gonna leave. You made me uncomfortable. You made it weird.<br /><br />AMIR: Because it s- it was not even sexual.<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) Wow. Really? Right now you're gonna say- Oh God. Dude, I didn't think it was. Don't make it a sexual thing.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) I guess now it grosses you out because you think it's a sexual thing. (In a mocking sexy tone) Give Daddy a bite. Give Daddy a bite. I wasn't even saying it like-<br /><br />JAKE: You saying that makes it kind of a sexual thing.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) What? Because I'm saying it's not a thing makes it a thing? Okay. So, this is not a computer. I guess that makes it a computer. Is that how it works?<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) No, I'm not trying to put that on you. Oh my God. Just...Drop it. Just drop it.<br /><br />JAKE: Why don't you just drop it?<br /><br />AMIR: (Drops a coin) I want to drop it but you're turning this into a bigger deal than it already is!<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) You're harping on it!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Look at the veins in your neck coming out right now.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) Oh my God. Veins in my neck. Ooo. Wow. They're gay too. I guess you're freaked out by them because they're calling you daddy. <br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) You always get so stressed out. Just- Dude, just let it go.<br /><br />JAKE: You said something that offended me and I'm gonna leave. That's it.<br /><br />AMIR: So you're going to leave?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, I'm going to leave<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) You're just going to take off for the rest of the day because I called you a nickname? How's that going to work? (Mimic being on the phone) Oh sorry, I'm going to work from home today. Yeah. Amir called me a thing. I guess I'm freaked out and I don't want to be here anymore. If that freaks you out. If that little amount of stuff freaks you out then maybe you shouldn't be here maybe you shouldn't be at work. Because in this environment people call each other nicknames all the time!<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) Yes. I think I'm going to go home. I'll work-I'll work from home. I'll email everyone and say I'm working from home. Not a thing, you called yourself daddy. Shut up dude. Yeah! Maybe I will leave! I'm going to leave. You know what I'm going to do-<br /><br />JAKE: With the yelling, you can stop it right now. I'm going to go home. I've lost my appetite. You don't get the sandwich. I'm gonna throw it away.

You're watching Jake and Amir.<br /><br />Amir: 2011 y'all!<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />[intro]<br /><br />[Jake and Amir sitting at their desks, Amir starts to dose off]<br /><br />Jake: Hey can you not fall asleep right now? We need to talk about that disgusting habit that you've picked up.<br /><br />Amir: It's called butt chugging, and last time I checked, it wasn't disgusting.<br /><br />Jake: Really? Have you checked recently? Because according to the news story that I saw, it involves sticking a funnel inside your asshole, and ingesting alcohol through your colon.<br /><br />Amir [unfolding a scroll]: Top ten wines to butt chug!<br /><br />Jake [interrupting]: Where do you go scroll shopping? Did you raid an ancient pirate ship or something?<br /><br />Amir: By Amir [long bleep is heard and Amir's mouth is censored] Blumenfeld.<br /><br />Jake: How about you never say that again in the office.<br /><br />Amir [reading off the scroll]: Number ten! I'll say it again. If the taste is heinous, shove it up your anus! you'll get drunk better, faster, stronger.<br /><br />Jake: That is what you did last night at my new year's party, but do you think you were drunker better than anybody? because I think you should up blackout drunk at seven P.M., in half a tuxedo, just the top half, you were naked waist down. You had a glass champagne flute stuck inside your butt, and you were dancing around singing \"happy new queer\".<br /><br />Amir: Number nine, that's wine and dine! A Chardonnay and a fish fillet, blend it up, dinner and a drink, now that won't stink.<br /><br />Jake: You're talking about shoving blended fish inside your butt, then yeah I bet it does.<br /><br />Amir: To each, her own.<br /><br />Number eight, it must be fate. A Zinfandel for this infidel make me think, don't ask, do tell. I stick a funnel in my butt.<br /><br />Jake: We all know what you do, ok? You ruined New Year's. When everybody was counting down you bent over and farted Vodka onto the TV.<br /><br />Amir: I'm the life and death, of every party.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah you definitely killed the mood when you slipped and fell and shattered that glass Champagne flute inside your body. We took you to the hospital but the doctor refused to operate on you. He said, in the long run it might be better if you just die.<br /><br />Amir: Number seven, is Levant. That's right, I soak a full body bread in a Jewish rye bread, and this ass, gets fed. Aka, you freeze the loaf and chisel off little suppositories that you stick inside your ass all night like little Tic-Tacs.<br /><br />Jake: Is that what you do with Tic-Tacs?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: Why?<br /><br />Amir: Number six, it's for dicks! Take a Capri-Sun straw and stick it in your urethra. With a reverse piss, you can't miss.<br /><br />Jake: So you graduated to dick chugging?<br /><br />Amir: With honors, sir.<br /><br />Amir: Number five, P. nomwar? More like p. yes. - Lar.<br /><br />Jake: Woah.<br /><br />Amir: Woah<br /><br />Jake: Bad.<br /><br />Amir [disappointed]: Oh.<br /><br />Jake: Terrible rhyme.<br /><br />Amir: No?<br /><br />Jake: How did that make your final draft?<br /><br />Amir: It didn't.<br /><br />Jake: This isn't a final? Why are you reading it in front of me?<br /><br />Amir: Number four. One Tequila, two Tequila, three Tequila, sore. Ow, if your anus ain't bruised all night, then you ain't funnelin' right.<br /><br />Jake: Is there a right way to funnel? If there is, I bet you don't know it. 'Cause why else do you have those shards of glass inside your anal cavity right now?<br /><br />Amir: Number three, you and me. Sippin' on some English tea.<br /><br />Jake: So not butt chugging.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, no, no, no. We're sipping it through our assholes.<br /><br />Jake: Definitely not doing that with you.<br /><br />Amir: Number two, how about some Yoo-hoo where you poo-poo. That's right, it's already wet and brown downtown, mamma mia, that's some diarrhea!<br /><br />Jake: I think what I'm gonna do is e-mail Paul...<br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: ...and ugh, see if I have the permission to send you home, or if he will. Um, you need to not be here today.<br /><br />Amir: How is that your call to make?<br /><br />Jake: I'm gonna tell him the circumstances and see if I can send you home.<br /><br />Amir: That's so illogical to me.<br /><br />Jake: Really?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: That's illogical? 'Cause I think getting your anus wounds untreated, leaving the hospital saying: \"Fuck this quack, you're a hack\", I think that's illogical.<br /><br />Amir: Not fair.<br /><br />Jake: That's not fair? What you're doing to your body isn't fair.<br /><br />Amir: I'm almost done with the list.<br /><br />Jake: Three of your top ten haven't even been alcohol. One of them involved shoving a straw inside your dick. I mean that's self-mutilation bud, and I think all of them will kill you.<br /><br />Amir: Number one, have some fun in the sun hun. Bring your ass to the beach, and flop it down like a leech. Put your knees by your ears, but don't feed your butt beers. Not Vodka nor Gin, no those can't go in. Spread your butt cheeks wide, stick that funnel inside, now wait for the tide you're going for a ride. You're a full grown guy, with a tight brown eye, so make sure your lips are sealed, and your rectum is peeled. Which alcohol is best, for your asshole that stretch? Not red nor white, nor Captain Morgan's Delight, no. What will save the day? Oh you don't say? it's: drum roll please.<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: A simple Rose.<br /><br />[Jake start clapping slowly]<br /><br />Amir: Thank you.<br /><br />Jake: I don't mean it. Are you done with the list?<br /><br />Amir: Not 'till I celebrate, [takes out a glass of blended fish and alcohol, and a funnel], with a number nine.<br /><br />Jake: Please not now, not here at the office.<br /><br />[Amir starts pouring the drink into the funnel, and looks in pain].<br /><br />Jake: Oh no! Ah!<br /><br />Amir [in pain]: Ah! It's in me.<br /><br />",

You can't talk it, you don't say did can talk it, you moron.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a moron.<br /><br />AMIR: Does anyone want sandwiches?  There.  That's my question.  God forbid I ask it!<br /><br />GUY: I'll take a sandwich.<br /><br />STELLA: Yeah.<br /><br />STREETER: Sure, I'll take one.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh what a surprise, Streeter wants a sandwich.  Oh wait, that's not a surprise.  The way he's bigger than anyone else is that he eats sandwiches more frequently than the average person.<br /><br />S: Come on!<br /><br />AMIR: Ten dollars, everybody give me ten dollars.<br /><br />JAKE: So you're not buying them.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm BUYING them.  I just don't want to PAY FOR THEM, you grammar Nazi.  Who here thinks I'm right?<br /><br />(Stella raises her hand)<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />AMIR: I like word play.  I've always been the kind of girl who's been like Hmmm, I don't know, CAN you go to the bathroom? Heh.<br /><br />AMIR: I like this one.  Her skin's a little greasy and her eyebrows are WAY too thick, but she's fun, and I think she likes me, too.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, you were just narrating that entire thing.<br /><br />AMIR: It was then that I realized I was narrating along the entire time.  Did the grease princess hear what I had to say about her eyebrows.  We may never know?<br /><br />STELLA: Yeah, I did.<br /><br />AMIR: My mind was racing.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, let's just play.  Uh, Stella, you're small blinds.  Streeter, you're big.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, he is very big.<br /><br />JAKE: You know what dude, that's enough, you can go home.  Cuz  I said no talking, and if anything, you're talking more than you usually do.  You seem incapable of even having an internal monologue.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, give me one more chance!  Give me one more chance!  If I make one joke that makes everybody here crack the fuck up, then I get to stay and play.<br /><br />JAKE: Why would I agree to that?<br /><br />AMIR: Because if I don't, if my joke falls flat, then I will leave you alone for the rest of your life.<br /><br />JAKE: (Beat) Wow.

The camera is pointed at the floor.]<br /><br />JAKE: [panicked] Wh-whoa whoa hey hey-<br /><br />[Cut to the opening credits. Jake and Amir are both dancing, and text vaguely matching the lyrics flashes on screen in time to the song.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ace and Jocelyn, Ace and Jocelyn, from space and Jocelyn!

I'm always taping you.<br /><br />[During the ensuing argument, a drawing of a woman who is riding a phallic rocket and has had Amir's face crudely edited on to her floats by and obscures the video.]<br /><br />JAKE: Okay-- well, I-- you know what? Give me the camera, alright? 'Cuz I  need to-- erase that-- footage...<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] No! Get off of me! What are you doing? Oh, your hands smell like Vaseline!<br /><br />[The camera turns, and Jake is wrestling Amir for control of the camera.

To get the enemy intelligence!<br /><br />AMIR: It's too obvious! It's too obvious.<br /><br />[The frame page-curls away. Jake and Amir are now walking down the street.]<br /><br />JAKE: All right, Jocelyn. What's the plan?<br /><br />AMIR: The plan is there's a nuclear reactor down by the river. I say we go down there, and try to defuse it!<br /><br />JAKE: Great idea, but... pretty cold down there. You sure the reactor's not indoors somewhere?<br /><br />AMIR: It's not indoors! It's outdoors. Okay? Stick to the script, and you will go there in a T-shirt for this insubordination!<br /><br />JAKE: Dude, relax!<br /><br />AMIR: Unless you want me to leak the footage of you jer--<br /><br />[The frame star-wipes to Jake and Amir at the riverside.]<br /><br />JAKE: Here we are at the river, and, uh... fortunately, there's no nuclear reactor, so I guess we should, uh...<br /><br />AMIR: No no no, it's probably... at the bottom of the river. You should go in and check it out.<br /><br />JAKE: Aaah, no. Dammit, we're... we're foiled, 'cuz... the river is too... frigid, and... polluted and filthy to... to go in...<br /><br />AMIR: Well clearly you don't have a problem being filthy! Right? I have footage on here that shows you not having a problem being filthy, and I can go back upstairs and friggin' upload it!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? You know what, dude? That's it.

Amir is walking and videotaping his face.]<br /><br />JAKE: [off-screen] Okay, we have to get back to my apartment, now.<br /><br />AMIR: That was epic, man. I totally recorded it-- Oh, shit...<br /><br />[Diamond-wipe to Jake, soaking wet and wrapped up in a blanket in his apartment.]<br /><br />JAKE: Did you get it?<br /><br />AMIR: Uhh, well, good news and bad news, heh: Good news is, you get to jump in the river again! Yay! That was... fun. The bad news is, due to a camera malfunction, the, um... the footage was sort of lost.

Bad you!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Amir: I've been alive for almost a decade now-<br /><br />Jake: Wrong.<br /><br />Amir: And I have nothing to show for it, save for a few successful business ventures and a lovely wife!<br /><br />Jake: You don't have those things.<br /><br />Amir: Kick me while I'm down why don't you?<br /><br />Jake: Well why all this sadness? Why now?<br /><br />Amir: I just got a letter from myself. Sent to me when I was 12 years old as part of a sixth grade class project where every student was supposed to send a letter to your future self. Turns out, every single student sent a letter to me. Yeah, 28 different letters that all start out with the same sentence: I hope you're not alive to read this. How do you think that makes me feel?<br /><br />Jake: I don't know, bad.<br /><br />Amir: Wrong! ...Like shit!<br /><br />Jake: So I wasn't wrong.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, this one's a gem, alright, you're gonna love this one.<br /><br />Jake: What would I love about this?<br /><br />Amir (Reading from the letter): Dear Amir, I hope you're not alive to read this. So, you have a black heart and no brain. You're ruthless mean and dumb. P.S. Do the Bills ever win the superbowl?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, that's pretty mean for a 12 year old.<br /><br />Amir: That one's from the teacher!<br /><br />Jake: Ms. Nesbit?<br /><br />Amir: MS. Nesbit actually, she would have been pissed at you. <br /><br />Jake: I said Ms. Nesbit.<br /><br />Amir: You want one from a mean tween though? Meaner than you've ever seen? Well I got one for you, Mr. Bean.<br /><br />Jake: Just read the letter.<br /><br />Amir (Reading): Dear Amir, I hope you're not alive to read this. Every day my dad gives me poison to sneak into your thermos of soup.  All I want for my birthday is the courage to finally kill you. He said you're dad is an evil man and he's raising you to be the spawn of Satan. Love, Penis Anthony Doubineux. P.S. Go Bills. Can you believe I knew a kid with the last name Doubineux?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I know him.<br /><br />Amir: How do you know Doobs?<br /><br />Jake: I've met him. Several times. <br /><br />Amir: Letter the third from my best friend Kyle. Dear Amir, DIE, Go Bills, Love Kyle. <br /><br />Jake: You're adding love to the end of it. <br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: Did you grow up in Buffalo?<br /><br />Amir: Niagara Falls actually. My mom is a French-Canadian queen and my dad is an Army rat. <br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: Mainly a rat coward who went AWOL during his time at Vietnam. Faked his own death now twice but thrice during the span of 18 months and gave away the names and locations of over 1000 of his comrades. <br /><br />Jake: God, what a traitor!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! For the he received the black heart. Congressional medal of dishonor.<br /><br />Jake: I feel like every time we have a conversation I just, I get so sad for you. <br /><br />Amir: Worry not.

One martini comin' up!<br /><br />AMIR: No: what happened with me and my friend? Best friend, actually. Or so I thought.<br /><br />WAITRESS: Oh. No.<br /><br />AMIR: He ditch-ditch-ditched me.<br /><br />[The waitress goes to leave, but Amir holds her back by the arm.]<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, one second. Where's the hostess? Let's call her over; she saw the whole thing.<br /><br />WAITRESS: Let go of my arm... and I'll go get her.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine.<br /><br />[He lets go of her arm.]<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, what's her name? I can just call her over.<br /><br />WAITRESS: It's Jessica. I'll just go grab--<br /><br />AMIR: Perfect. Jessica!

I was just telling, um...<br /><br />[There is a pause, but not a very long one.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's when you say your name, sweetheart. It's called flirting. [to Jessica] You saw when my best friend left, right? After I told that good joke?<br /><br />JESSICA: ...Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: Look, I knew you thought it was funny, didn't you? For an off-the-cuff one-liner?<br /><br />JESSICA: Um...<br /><br />AMIR: Um what?<br /><br />JESSICA: ...It was fine,<br /><br />AMIR: [in a robot voice] It was fine... No it was not fine... It was good... [speaking normally] Okay, tell it like it is. All right? Obviously I wouldn't Tweet it. I have a very unpopular twitter account: USARice. Follow it if you scare! [imitating Dracula's iconic laugh] Moo ooo ahh ahh ahh...<br /><br />[There is a long pause. Amir holds the Dracula face.]<br /><br />AMIR: DO you honestly think he should have left, though? Over one joke?<br /><br />JESSICA: Well, I kinda get the sense that you make those jokes a lot...<br /><br />AMIR: Granted! Okay? But that's almost enough out of you, so please... proceed with caution.<br /><br />JESSICA: Well maybe he was just fed up, and... didn't want to be here anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: And that actually is enough out of you. Thank you so much, Jessica; you're trying to be nice, but you're giving me a legit migraine right now.<br /><br />JESSICA: Well I also got the sense that he didn't want to be here to begin with, so...<br /><br />AMIR: [mock laughter] It's my birthday today. [pause] Wow, suddenly the customer's always right! I'll have that martini for free now, and as for the steak, I think... no, in fact I know I'm going to be eating it off your ass.<br /><br />[The waitress slaps Amir in the face.]<br /><br />AMIR : Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Woo! Yeah! That's a lawsuit. That is a lawsuit. Good news, everybody! My name's Jake Hurwitz and dinner's on me, because this establishment now owes me a million dollars! In the form of a suit. [tugs his collar] Class action!<br /><br />[The waitress begins crying.]<br /><br />JESSICA: It's fine, Chloe. It's gonna be fine.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's fine! It's fine? Or do I have a video tape... of the whole frickin' thing?<br /><br />[Amir holds up his iPhone, which has a recording of him playing.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the iPhone] It's fine? Or do I have a video tape of the whole frickin' thing?<br /><br />AMIR: Nooooo!<br /><br />[Jake comes back to the restaurant.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, man. I'm sorry. I cooled off. It's just I really hate when you make those jokes. You know?<br /><br />[Amir nods.]<br /><br />JAKE: What's going on? Did you make this girl cry?<br /><br />AMIR: I made her realize that she was being a proud little diva tramp floozy!<br /><br />[Jake slaps Amir in the face.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's another lawsuit!

What do you want me to say?<br /><br />Amir: I spent the better part of a G of not my own money trying to make my old man proud.

Amir slides in to sit next to him at an impossible speed, and is wearing the shirt with the bloody shoulder from Zombie. He is holding a pen and a pad of sticky notes.]<br /><br />AMIR: As you probably already know, my great-uncle Gryan donated $100,000 dollars to me to start a business.<br /><br />JAKE: I actually didn't know that, ok DON'T start a business; let's talk, we can invest the money.<br /><br />AMIR: I already invested the money, ok? I bought 10,000 stars and named them after you, so first of all, you're welcome, second of all, let's think of business ideas so that I can get my money back.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright I'm actually no longer interested, thank you--<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, well scht- let me rattle off some of these ideas, and then you can tell me if they have legit potential or not. Number 1:--<br /><br />JAKE: Before you get started, no ideas that have anything to do with stars.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, number 4. Oh actually, number 10 then.<br /><br />AMIR: So you know to pop a zit on your back you need like a really long staw (makes a straw slurping noise), and some elbow grease.<br /><br />JAKE: No..<br /><br />AMIR: You know how everybody and their widow is just aching to have a song written about them?<br /><br />JAKE: You mean dead people?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well dead people have money, too.<br /><br />JAKE: They actually don't.<br /><br />AMIR: Do th- Oh my God, ok, so all these ideas are then a no-go..<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, look at that, you just drew a picture of a cemetery with dollar signs all over it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah I thought it was a graveyard of money.<br /><br />AMIR: So you know about Caps Lock, right?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, well this is Caps UNlock; yeah I'll give you all your lowercase letters, for a fee! Hehehe it's brilliant, are you kidding me it's genius!--<br /><br />JAKE: Ok you just hit Caps Lock again and it all goes back to lowercase.<br /><br />AMIR: You gotta be shitting me with that!<br /><br />[Amir is making a silly face (hereafter dubbed his listening face)]<br /><br />JAKE: You know you don't have to make that face when you listen to people.<br /><br />AMIR: Well it just helps!<br /><br />AMIR: Alright what's the worst part about aprons, on three, ready? One, two, three, they're too grey--<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing.<br /><br />AMIR: --Right, ok, nevermind.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright let's say I know how to knit a sweater and you know how to speak German, so let's teach each other, let's trade our skill-sets and become more talented people.<br /><br />JAKE: That's not a bad business idea.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, wait 'til you hear the name of the business - Tick Dicklers<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I'm gonna pass because I assume the name is--<br /><br />AMIR: Non-negotiable, that's correct.<br /><br />AMIR: You know the hardest part about making toast is beating up and stealing bread from a baker.<br /><br />JAKE: What?..<br /><br />AMIR: WELL, ok let me finish, my business will loot that bakery and steal the bread for you.<br /><br />JAKE: Ok it sounds illegal.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I looked into it, ok? And it is, you're right, it is; how did you know that?<br /><br />AMIR: (frustrated) AAGH I can't stand it anymore, you're so negative all the time! Stop saying no no no no no no no, think!<br /><br />AMIR: (singing) It's nineteen dollars for a single one, so eat it bitches, cuz boy that's fun, I ca--<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, you can't cuss in jingles.--<br /><br />AMIR: Bitches is not a cuss, alright, but noted, cuz this thing does get very racy very soon--<br /><br />JAKE: (reading Amir's sticky notes) Whoa, yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: (reading Amir's sticky notes as he flips through them) Oh wow, more tombstones with dollar signs on 'em.<br /><br />AMIR: Yea.<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping) Oh sheesh y'all, it's a cream!

That's not the issue.<br /><br />Amir: Why wear something that people can only compliment sarcastically?<br /><br />Jake: I missed a spot, I missed one spot, so I said 'fuck it, I'll go with a chinner'<br /><br />Amir: A chinner?<br /><br />Jake: Winner Winner Chicken Chinner, yeah! Any questions?<br /><br />Amir: Why did you do it?<br /><br />Jake: Not a question.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah it is.<br /><br />Jake: Here's a science fact: Chicks dig scars. Or was Ice Cube at the 'Are We There Yet' cast  crew after-party sponsored by Voss Water not stylin'?<br /><br />Amir:  Do chicks dig chin strap beards?<br /><br />Jake: Does it matter? 'Cause I can shave it off. Also, it was a joke! I build up a defensive wall so thick you can't get through it with dynamite.  How's that for insecure?<br /><br />Amir:  I respect you so much but sometimes you make me really sad for you.<br /><br />Jake: A chin strap for this thin chap make the fat booty go clap. I made out with my nephew. At a house party.<br /><br />Amir: Sorry, what?<br /><br />Jake:  I get invited to house parties, is what I'm saying.<br /><br />Amir: You kissed-You have a, wait- You have a nephew?<br /><br />Jake: He's a little twerp.

No. I crashed their party and I was j-<br /><br />Amir: So you weren't invited?<br /><br />Jake: To their house party? No.<br /><br />Amir: You said you get invited to house parties.<br /><br />Jake: Not that one! I get invited to other house parties. I wasn't invited to this one. I get invited to other house parties, ok? Anyway I show up, I'm jackin' all the poon,  they come up to me and they're like 'uh uh dude, you weren't invited, and we're 16'<br /><br />Amir: And then you made out with him?<br /><br />Jake:  A little bit, yeah! And I obviously forgot to mention that I was <br /><br />Robotripping.<br /><br />Amir: Robotripping?<br /><br />Jake: It's called you polish off a bottle of  Robitussin, you wash it down with two pumps of capri sun. I would eat dog shit if Bradley Cooper did it in Limitless.<br /><br />[Enter Murphy]<br /><br />Murphy: Hey Jake, can I borrow your copy of Limitless?<br /><br />Jake: Dude, I'm shaving it.<br /><br />Murphy: What are you talking about?<br /><br />Jake: This chin strap, it's obviously a goof, I'm shaving it as we squeak.<br /><br />Murphy: I don't know man, I think it looks pretty cool.<br /><br />Jake:  So do I. It does make me look quite 'strapping'<br /><br />Murphy: Haha, uh, I was joking. It sucks.<br /><br />Jake: Dude, I was joking too.  Haha. Tell me what to think.  Honestly, because I'll pull the hair out right now if you say the word.<br /><br />Pat Cassels:  Jesus, Jake, why are you insecure?<br /><br />Amir: He's not, ok, it's called Robotripping! Have you ever done it? No, probably not because you're too scared to even eat dog shit!<br /><br />Murphy: Are you crying?<br /><br />Jake: Dude, he for real! I made out with my nephew.<br /><br />Amir: He did. At a house party.<br /><br />Jake: House party. Tell them where it was, dude.<br /><br />Amir: He kissed him at a house party.<br /><br />Murphy: You're both crying so much!<br /><br />Jake: We're beefing.<br /><br />Amir: We're beefing.<br /><br />Jake: We're beefing.<br /><br />Amir: We're beefing.<br /><br />Jake: We beef.<br /><br />",

You like my underwear?<br /><br />Jake: That's your penis.<br /><br />Amir: Alright.<br /><br />Episode<br /><br />(Amir is smoking a hookah, when Jake comes into the office)<br /><br />Amir: Mm. Hit?<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Come over.<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Smoking a hookah.<br /><br />Jake: I see that.<br /><br />Amir: Not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Jake: You know, it's actually not, but clearly think it is. Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten to work, set up the entire hookah, and <br /><br />then waited for me to get here so you could ask me to smoke with you.<br /><br />(Amir moves his mouth as if he's blowing smoke rings)<br /><br />Jake: Nothing's coming out of your mouth so you're definitely not blowing smoke rings.<br /><br />Amir: Don't blow smoke up my ass.<br /><br />Jake: I don't think that's lit, man.<br /><br />Amir: I have strawberry. I have strawberry and apple and watermelon and mint, and mint is the bomb, and it's smooth, and if you mix it <br /><br />with strawberry it tastes like a mojito.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you think this is cool?<br /><br />Amir: Why is drinking alcohol cool? Hm? Why is riding on a motorcyle cool? Why is wearing SPF of less than 10 at the beach cool?<br /><br />Jake: I don't that think that is cool.<br /><br />Amir: Because it's dangerous! Being safe is for mothers and nerds, and last time I checked, I'm have a pussy.<br /><br />Jake: ...what?!<br /><br />Amir: I said I don't have a pussy!<br /><br />Jake: No you didn't! You didn't say that! You said I'm have a pussy!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: Have you even done any work at all today?<br /><br />Amir: (Holding up the hookah hose) Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: So setting up the hookah was your work.<br /><br />Amir: No, I also did regular work.<br /><br />Jake: Where's your computer? It's not out.<br /><br />Amir: (Holding up his backpack, from which mewing can be heard) It's in my fricking backpack!<br /><br />Jake: Is there a fucking cat in there with it?!<br /><br />Amir: Chill it with this line of questioning, okay! It's not becoming of either of us. You're stressing me out.<br /><br />Jake: Your computer's not out, it's not on; you haven't done any work at all.<br /><br />Amir: I've been checking my Gmail on my work phone.<br /><br />Jake: You have a work phone?<br /><br />Amir: (Mocking Jake) Yeah I have a work phone.<br /><br />Jake: Where's your phone?<br /><br />Amir: (Opening his backpack) It's here.<br /><br />Jake: In the bag.<br /><br />Amir: (Brandishing his phone) Yeah, in the bag.<br /><br />Jake: How are you checking it?<br /><br />(Amir shakes his head idly)<br /><br />Jake: Gimme your phone.<br /><br />(Amir tosses Jake his phone)<br /><br />Amir: Careful, it's dirty!<br /><br />Jake: It smells like soy sauce and yoghurt!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, the lock screen is all... messed up. It's like—<br /><br />Jake: Not the lock screen. All the buttons are just stuck together, it's one giant button. You ruined your phone.<br /><br />Amir: I'm starting to not even be in the mood to smoke.<br /><br />Jake: Stop trying so hard.<br /><br />Amir: Why? Huh? Because you shouldn't try to be cool! You should just be yourself and not care what other people think?<br /><br />Jake: Yes.<br /><br />Amir: No! No, absolutely not! Last week, I paid 2000 dollars for a getting-with-chicks seminar. And guess what happened: final exam <br /><br />time rolls around and we're at a bar, and every single one of us hooks up with a girl. That's right: we all made out like bandits. And <br /><br />on my way home, guess what I saw: the teacher of the class, Sean, he was discreetly paying every single girl that made out with us <br /><br />nerds money. And you know why?<br /><br />Jake: Because he hired whores to french you so you'd feel better about yourself!<br /><br />Amir: Because I'm cool!<br /><br />Jake: You know, with two grand you probably could have paid girls to do a lot more than just make out with you.<br /><br />Amir: What.<br /><br />",

I don't wanna do this chore!'\"<br /><br />JAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three:\"<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit...<br /><br />AMIR: \"...fireworks for me!

I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!<br /><br />JAKE: That's actually really smart--<br /><br />AMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis! [laughs] I knew you'd shit on it! [laughs] Isn't your face redder than a beet! ...Speaking of beets, [puts his arm around Jake] do you got a garden?

No!<br /><br />Jake: When do you do this?<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: When do you come up with these shitty rhymes?<br /><br />Amir: It's not even a \"my jokes are bad\" thing, I know you think it's that way, but that mini soda thing crushed yesterday at my cousin's brit.<br /><br />Jake: Ew!<br /><br />Amir: I really think that the diva mouse can take it this year, this crazy little shifty mouse.<br /><br />Jake: I know that's what you think.<br /><br />Amir: No, I'm serious! I mean, he's got a snowball's chance in hell, sure, but in this tournament that's all you need. I mean, who had 'Nova topping Georgetown in '85, nobody.<br /><br />Jake: People had it. I mean, it was a long shot, but at least it was a basketball team.<br /><br />Amir: Fuckin' asshole.<br /><br />Jake: What?! What did you just say? Say it again.<br /><br />Amir: Butler University. Hey Jake, the butler did it! They're Final Four bound. And gagged!<br /><br />Jake: You crossed them out.<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: You don't have Butler, you crossed them out. That's where you wrote Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />Amir: That tricky mouse fink is up to tricks! I didn't cross them out, you gotta believe me. Do you believe me?<br /><br />Jake: No!<br /><br />Amir: This year's Cinderella story? It's gonna be me! I'm gonna wear a gown to the Final Four and sit on a pumpkin instead of a seat.<br /><br />What's the opposite of a Prince Charming, you ask. How about a Dunce Harming?<br /><br />Jake: Not quite buddy. A dunce, a prince, not quite.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I know it's not quite there, I was just hoping you weren't listening.<br /><br />Jake: You talk, hoping I'm not listening?<br /><br />Amir: Oh, Syracuse winning it all, huh? Bold!<br /><br />Jake: You don't like that pick?<br /><br />Amir: No, I love that pick. Especially because it's 2003, right? Carmelo's still playing basketball? We just killed Saddam Hussein, so that's a positive.<br /><br />Jake: I get it.<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: I get it!<br /><br />Amir: So, George gets a town, Louis gets a ville, and what does little ol' Amir get? Nothing but a public urination ticket and a slap on the wrist. That's not fair.<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: Whoah, great news! In your world, iTunes just launched, that's a great investment opportunity!<br /><br />Jake: I'll change the pick!<br /><br />Amir: Why would you? I'm sure the Governator, you know Arnold Schwarzenegger, the new governor of California would endorse your pick, especially if he just got finished watching Finding Nemo, the new Pixar flick that just came out!<br /><br />Jake: How do you know so much about 2003?!<br /><br />Amir: How do you know so little about basketball?!<br /><br />Jake: You still have MICKEY MOUSE winning it all!<br /><br />Amir: That's because he's a diva little mousey bitch!",

A lot of people were dying, and I froze. But this brave, brave man stepped forward and took my son off my hands so I could apprehend a murderer.<br /><br />Jake: You sure he didn't just take advantage of the situation in order to steal your baby?<br /><br />Cop: WOW. Permission to kick this man's ass, sir.<br /><br />Amir: Denied. Denied.<br /><br />Jake: I just got this text message from him five minutes ago. \"Hey dude, jacked a baby on the way to work.

You said you wouldn't interrupt me!<br /><br />Jake: You know what I think happened? I think you got into the idea of owning fur after some weird conversation you had with your cousin Leron or some strange show you saw on TV. You became fur-obsessed, going on a morbid spending spree. And when you ran out of acceptable animals to wear on your body, your blood-thirsty raid took you to the deep, dark corners of the animal wear/ware kingdom, like that pocket iguana or your rat wallet. Either way, you reek of mink and rat blood! So go home!

Maybe I can join you in your ivory tower for just a couple minutes, and that'll help me cool off. Or I can hop upon your high horse, and we can go for a ride! You know what? I got this idea from having a conversation with my cousin Leron, not from a \"television show,\" as you astutely observed.<br /><br />Jake: You know, I also said that. That was my first guess.<br /><br />Amir: Secondly, yeah! I became fur-obsessed! You know, it's my nature to take things too far; some people love me for that.<br /><br />Jake: Nobody loves you.. for anything.<br /><br />Amir: (pretend stabs heart) OH!<br /><br />Jake: No, that did hurt you; I know it.<br /><br />Amir: A little bit, yes, because I didn't think you'd get that personal.<br /><br />Jake: Just move on.<br /><br />Amir: I became blood-hungry! Sure, who wouldn't? And who wouldn't feel a little bit guilty after strangling a scared iguana? Obviously, animals can't... (laughs) talk! But this little guy was begging me with his eyes for mercy. I don't know if you've ever seen an iguana cry before, but I know for a fact that I have.<br /><br />Jake: Can you stop talking about strangling the iguana?<br /><br />Amir: And as for your last point, I think I will go home as this has turned into a public shaming of me! Adieu!<br /><br />Jake: Are you wearing dead doves on your feet?<br /><br />Amir: THEY'RE RAVENS.<br /><br />Jake: They're white.<br /><br />Amir: THEY'RE... DOVES.<br /><br />THE END",

Except you don't get extra points for jumping high, do you?<br /><br />A: On this game, yes.<br /><br />J: Not coins, though! We're looking for coins, aren't we bud! You really are a simple, simple...<br /><br />A: 201 coins!<br /><br />J: BITCH! Jake takes the phone and finishes the game<br /><br />J: Lemme play! Haha! 213 coins!

I'm a golden god, and you're a troll named Rod.<br /><br />Amir starts beefing<br /><br />J: Sorry, Rod, but it's true!<br /><br />A: NO!<br /><br />J: Unfortunately, you are a troll named Rod, and that is your name. And I'd know that because I got 213 coins on my first try, didn't I Rod?<br /><br />Streeter walks in the room<br /><br />Streeter: Hey, Jake and Amir. You guys didn't come to the all-hands meeting and now Paul wants to see you.<br /><br />J: You mean Jake and Rod?<br /><br />Streeter: Yeah. Are you making him cry?<br /><br />A: How can I not cry?

Amir is playing with two plastic dinosaur toys.]<br /><br />AMIR: Hallelujah? Nah... holla me. Yeah!<br /><br />[Amir makes the T-Rex bite the stegosaurus's jugular, groans for emphasis, and makes a fart noise. Jake's phone rings, and he picks it up.]<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Hey! Hey, yeah, I was wondering if you could come to that meeting today.<br /><br />[Amir, believing he's being spoken to, snaps to attention and slams the toys onto the desk.]<br /><br />AMIR: Me?<br /><br />[Jake continues on the phone.]<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Yeah, yeah. In the, uh... junior conference room.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! Uh... totally. The junior--? Which one's the junior conference room?<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] It's at, uh, three-thirty?<br /><br />AMIR: Absolutely! Are-- you sure you're gonna want me there? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled. I'm just a little... thrown off, is all.<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] We could push it to four...<br /><br />AMIR: No need! Three-thirty's actually better for me 'cause I have this cardiologist appointment that I'd hate to push...<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Alright. Four's good.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, okay, I'll-- ...yeah, I'll make things work; I'll shuffle it around. I just have this pacemaker thing that I need re-calibrated; it, like-- ah, it kills me.<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Cool!<br /><br />AMIR: Cool. Yeah, cool! Nah, you're right. Absolutely. I just-- I'm really close to death, but... totally. What should I bring? This is my first meeting. [chuckles] A fruit plate? What--<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Yo, shut up, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: Of course! I'm just excited about the meeting. Alright? In fact... permission to lead it?<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] I'm here. Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Alright, yeah! And I will be there too! I will be there leading the meeting! Then it is agreed-ing.<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Yo, you really have to be quiet.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't tell me how to conduct my own meeting, alright? I'm now the leader! And I'm not bringing a fruit plate to my own meeting only to be told how to act by some-- some underling, some college drop-out!<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Sorry, there's just this idiot yelling in my ear right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Apology accepted! But if you don't want someone yelling in your ear, I suggest you put down the phone!<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Alright! I'll see you there!<br /><br />[Jake hangs up.]<br /><br />AMIR: No you won't.<br /><br />JAKE: ...What?<br /><br />AMIR: What? \"What,\" like I'm not gonna be there? No... \"what\" like you're not gonna be there.<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about right now?<br /><br />AMIR: Don't worry about it, \"bro\"! [scoffs] Go back to watching wrestling, \"bro\"! [scoffs] Go back to eating chicken nuggets out of your brother's asshole, \"bro\"!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you think I said \"bro\" at some point? You're mimicking something you misheard.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't worry about it...<br /><br />JAKE: ...\"bro\"?<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] ...\"bro\"! Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay...<br /><br />[Jake is at the meeting. He is the only one not dressed in a suit.]<br /><br />JAKE: Well-- okay, I guess I didn't get the suit memo. I'm sorry about that. Uh, why don't we just jump right in--<br /><br />[Amir appears at the door holding a fruit plate and wearing a top hat and a sash reading \"LEADER\" in large gold letters.]<br /><br />AMIR: How's the heating in this meeting? If you're wondering why I'm asking, it's because I'm... Jake, what are you doing here?<br /><br />JAKE: Get out.<br /><br />AMIR: Of my own meeting? [laughs, holds up the fruit plate and points to it] Gee whiz, Jake! I'd rather not!<br /><br />JAKE: This isn't your meeting, man. Leave.<br /><br />AMIR: Treason! This is more than a coup d'etat!<br /><br />JAKE: I don't know where you got the impression that you were even allowed in this room, let alone leading our meeting.<br /><br />AMIR: Where I got the impression was from you, ya coward! In fact, you guys are all cowards for listening to this snake-oil salesman. [laughs] ...Get him. I'm sorry, Jake, but-- guys, get him.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I don't think--<br /><br />[The two guys next to Jake pin his hands to the table.]<br /><br />JAKE: --Okay, hey--<br /><br />[Gonny, the guy on Jake's left, addresses Amir.]<br /><br />Gonny: O Captain! My Captain! What shall we do with this traitor?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Off with his head!<br /><br />JAKE: \"Off with my head\", dude? [laughs] G--<br /><br />[Gonny stands up behind Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: Gonny... Gonny, what are you doing-- I-- oh!<br /><br />[Gonny grabs Jake's head and tries to rip it off. Amir looks on, and the other people present laugh and cheer.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ah! Okay! Ah, I'll leave! Ow, I'll leave!<br /><br />AMIR: You'll leave in a body bag, ya Benedict Hey-Arnold! Unless that's not your style, \"bro\"!<br /><br />JAKE: I never said \"bro\"!<br /><br />[Gonny yells with rage as he continues trying to decapitate Jake.]",

Congrats, bud! We're rich!<br /><br />[Amir puts his hand out and pantomimes a handshake.]<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I think I'm gonna work from the conference room today, so--<br /><br />AMIR: Oh wait-- we're actually not rich at all! 'Cause Zark Fuckernerd has us bent over a table, owning every single photo we've posted to Instagram! I'm sorry, pal!<br /><br />JAKE: ...Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Okay\"? No way! Instagram's new privacy policy claims that it can and will sell all of your photos to the highest bidder!<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about?<br /><br />AMIR: What am I talking about? I'm talking about you don't own your shit! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is, okay? That's why I posted this paragraph to my Facebook profile which should stop the bleeding for now while my lawyers look over the fine print. Actually, give me your email. I will forward you this paragraph and you gotta copy and paste it precisely. Otherwise they'll find the fuckin' loopholes in it, I swear to God they will. Those micey, micey bastards.<br /><br />JAKE: We've worked together for six years. Do you really not know my email?<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, better yet, don't even give it to me, 'cause I fear that my email is being monitored, hacked, or worse: both, by King Zark himself. Yeah, he's all up there, trollin' around looking for paintings and shit, art that I have in my head.<br /><br />JAKE: Art in your head?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! I'm being Thomas-Crown-Affaired by the Facebook dictator himself! Yeah, he's makin' his way into the art museum of my brain while I sleep, crawlin' around, makin' his way out with billion-- nay, million-dollar ideas for paintings and shit?<br /><br />JAKE: That's less money, okay? You really think Mark Zuckerberg wants to steal and then sell this photo of you... planking at a candlelight vigil? ...I mean, I don't even know what the vigil's for, but I think no matter what, it's pretty depraved!<br /><br />AMIR: \"I saw the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by madness. Starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix!\" Do you know who said that?<br /><br />JAKE: Allen Ginsberg.<br /><br />AMIR: Amir Blumenfeld!<br /><br />JAKE: No! No. You ass.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing maniacally, cackling] It's working! Don't you get it? It's absolutely working! He's pitting brother against brother!<br /><br />JAKE: Who is? Who's stealing from you?<br /><br />AMIR: Ginsberg! Zuckerberg! All these frickin' Jew billionaires! Don't you get it? I make these Instagram photos for me! I write these Facebook statuses for me, so that if one day, let's say I want to sell them, that should be my money! That's my prerogative; that should be my money!<br /><br />JAKE: W-- what are you talking about? What do you think you agreed to--<br /><br />AMIR: I'm saying if I want to approach a-- a huge brand, like a Doritos or a Coca-Cola--<br /><br />JAKE: They would never buy anything from you. You think they have any interest in your status? \"Going to the mall? Nah. Going to the mall high. Like this status and I'll smoke you out.\"<br /><br />AMIR: They like quirky, cheeky, irreverent humor.<br /><br />JAKE: That's not quirky, cheeky, or irreverent. It's not even humor.<br /><br />AMIR: Do you watch the British Office?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't ask me about the British Office.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious, do you watch the British Office, with Richard Gervais?<br /><br />JAKE: You're comparing your desperate wannabe-stoner status with one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time?<br /><br />AMIR: All's I know is that last night I had a dream of a painting, and today it's the friggin' logo of the Facebook! Okay? Is that just a coincidence? Are you really that ignorant? Are you really that fuckin' blind?<br /><br />JAKE: That's it, dude! That's it! Do something more important with your day.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. Fuck off, alright? Have a good life! Good luck being classless, assless, deaf, and dumb! You know why? 'Cause Facebook's robbin' ya! Instagram's rapin' ya! And Myspace? [puts his finger in his mouth and makes a popping sound] It's givin' ya the old how-do-you-do! [wiggles his finger in the air]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Holy shit.<br /><br />[Amir keeps wiggling his finger.]<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit, what are you saying?<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Here. [throws a baseball cap with \"FOR SALE\" printed on it at Jake] Here you go! You deserve this. Hey guys! Listen up, good news! Jake's now for sale! Make sure to make your check out to Zark frickin' Dinkenberg!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, yeah! [puts on the hat] Everybody, actually, while you're here-- this is good-- gather 'round, 'cause Amir's gonna delete his Facebook and Instagram!<br /><br />AMIR: ...Hah?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Hah?\" No, right? You found out they've been robbing us blind from the get-go! He's figured 'em out, so he's decided to take the moral high ground and delete both accounts.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, okay. You've made your point. Relax. You'll-- you'll make a martyr of me.<br /><br />JAKE: No, really! I really think you should do that. Delete both the accounts, right now.<br /><br />[Amir stares back silently, then without warning begins crying and covers his face.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Oh my God.<br /><br />[Amir sobs quietly to himself.]<br /><br />JAKE: You're an adult man. You're a grown-up; a fully-grown person. Jesus, buddy!<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] What, buddy? I'm sad.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay! I'm sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] I just-- I don't want to delete it! It's, like, the best website ever, and-- and Instagram is the tightest app.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, so keep it!<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] Okay. Yeah, you're right. And I'll take 'em down from the inside.<br /><br />[Pat walks up with a Red Bull can.]<br /><br />PAT: Hey Amir, congrats on being the new face of Red Bull!<br /><br />AMIR: Noooooo!<br /><br />PAT: Are you planking at a vigil on here?<br /><br />[The logo on Pat's Red Bull can is a photo of Amir planking in the middle of hundreds of candles.]",

On Amir's desk is a chicken idly looking around.]<br /><br />JAKE: I think I'm gonna work from home today.<br /><br />[Jake turns to leave, but is stopped by Rick Fox, who restrains Jake with a hand to the face.]<br /><br />RICK: Yeah, you're not going anywhere.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Rick Fox?<br /><br />RICK: I head you're the, uh, chicken whisperer.<br /><br />JAKE: From who?<br /><br />RICK: [points to Josh, who is working in the background] Everyone.<br /><br />JAKE: That's... just-- that's Josh.<br /><br />RICK: Yeah, I need your help.<br /><br />JAKE: What.<br /><br />RICK: My chicken's more than sick.

Did you come to steal more money from Amir?<br /><br />RICK: Actually, dick, I'm here to tell Amir that I'm out of the bookie business.<br /><br />[Amir gasps.]<br /><br />RICK: My beautiful wife, [to Jake] who is not a chicken...<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't say she was. You shouldn't have to clarify that.<br /><br />RICK: She convinced me I need a more honest trade.<br /><br />AMIR: Mm. Yeah, that makes sense.<br /><br />RICK: So I'm just here to collect Amir's eight-thousand-dollar quitting fee.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound very honest.<br /><br />AMIR: No, it is.

I'm getting really pissed off about it.<br /><br />RICK: You are the only one talking about eggs.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Fine, what have you spent your entire life obsessing over?<br /><br />RICK: Omelettes!<br /><br />JAKE: ...Omelettes are eggs! Omelettes are eg--<br /><br />[Rick picks Jake up by the collar.]<br /><br />RICK: What did you say?<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing! Nothing, okay? I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br /><br />RICK: Say it again. Say it one more time.<br /><br />AMIR: Say it to his face!<br /><br />JAKE: I don't want to!

Is that chicken over there your wife? Is that what's going on? You sick fuck!<br /><br />[Elisa Dushku shows up behind Rick Fox.]<br /><br />ELISA: Drop him.<br /><br />[Rick complies.]<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus... Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. I'm glad that I'm not the only person here who thinks this guy is completely--<br /><br />[Elisa picks up Jake by the collar.]<br /><br />ELISA: What did you say about eggs, motherfucker?<br /><br />JAKE: God. She's crazier.<br /><br />ELISA: Say it.

[to Rick] I learned that the hard way, remember?<br /><br />JAKE: No, chicken nuggets are made of chicken. They kill a chicken, grind up the meat and then shape it into nuggets.<br /><br />[Rick is taken aback. Elisa chuckles, but quickly stops.]<br /><br />ELISA: Come on, baby. Go. Go, go--<br /><br />[Rick runs to a garbage can and vomits.]<br /><br />RICK: I'm a cannibal!<br /><br />[Rick vomits again, then kneels in front of the chicken.]<br /><br />RICK: [to the chicken] Baby...

Jake and Amir are now both female, and appear to be Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer from Broad City. Amir wakes up.]<br /><br />ILANA-AMIR: Holy guac! That nap was more than legit: it was dec'!<br /><br />ABBI-JAKE: I think that might make it less than legit.<br /><br />ILANA-AMIR: Don't nitpick my twitpic, ya shit-dick! Now that wit was quite quick.<br /><br />ABBI-JAKE: Do you want me to get you some coffee?

Now I can't buy a basket.<br /><br />NICK-JAKE: Can you please try not to rhyme all of the time?<br /><br />BRIAN-AMIR: You just did it!<br /><br />NICK-JAKE: That was unintentional.<br /><br />BRIAN-AMIR: Oh, an unintentional rhyme? Well I'm an unconventional mime, [he moves his hands as if in an invisible box] eating an unpresentable lime.<br /><br />[Brian-Amir pantomimes taking a bite out of an invisible lime.]<br /><br />BRIAN-AMIR: Eww!-- Fuck you.

You knew that would fail.<br /><br />BRIAN-AMIR: Fuck you, fuck you, I'm cool, and fuck you.<br /><br />[Brian-Amir begins laughing.]<br /><br />BRIAN-AMIR: Ohh! Oh, it hurts to laugh, it hurts to laugh...<br /><br />[Harp and transition.

The truth comes tumbling out. Jake's a frickin' anti-Semite. And that just ain't right.<br /><br />ANDREW-JAKE: ...What?<br /><br />[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are themselves; Amir seems to be talking in his sleep.]<br /><br />AMIR: I said \"You, Jacob Hurwitz... you're an anti-Semite.\"<br /><br />[Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew and Evan have gathered around Jake's chair.]<br /><br />NICK: What did he just say?<br /><br />JAKE: He's half-asleep, dude. What do you mean \"what did he just say\"? It doesn't matter.<br /><br />ABBI: Oh, it doesn't matter because what? What, because he's a Jew?<br /><br />[Abbi shoves Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say that! What are you talking about?<br /><br />AMIR: [now very much awake] I'm talkin' about you hating Jew.<br /><br />ILANA: You prick! I know many Jews.<br /><br />JAKE: So do I! I'm half Jewish--<br /><br />[Brian punches Jake in the face.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ow!<br /><br />BRIAN: I don't hit like a Jew, do I?<br /><br />JAKE: ...That was anti-Semitic, what you just said!<br /><br />AMIR: Get him!<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about--<br /><br />[Everybody begins beating up Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey!

He has a bruised eye and a large, somewhat bloodstained head bandage.]<br /><br />AMIR: Is it viral?<br /><br />JAKE: I think it might go viral; it's you trying and failing to jack an iPhone on the subway.<br /><br />AMIR: Bull... shite! I got away with it! That video lies to you; it's propaganda!<br /><br />JAKE: No, it's actually not. I can see very clearly: this girl is texting on her iPhone and you just rip it out of her hands; you try to time it just right so you can get out there before the doors close--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: --but no. You thought it was a good idea to turn around and say [Amir begins pointing and mouthing Jake's quote, as if re-living the moment] \"time for you to disconnect permanently\", and then wink at her.<br /><br />[Amir nods in acknowledgement.]<br /><br />JAKE: How did you think you had time for that?<br /><br />[Amir is suddenly wearing a pair of sunglasses over his regular glasses.]<br /><br />AMIR: Frankly, my dear... [looks over the sunglasses] I don't give a damn.<br /><br />JAKE: You should give a damn, because here you are running around the train like an animal, like a scared rat, trying to burrow your way out of the door, large crowds just forming around you, and then you... you lay on the ground; you start kicking and screaming. I mean... listen to this.<br /><br />[Jake unplugs his headphones and hits the volume-up key. Amir's voice fades in. As they listen, Amir, whose sunglasses disappeared again at some point, nods in acknowledgement of the audio. Jake shakes his head to say \"no\". Amir copies Jake mockingly.]<br /><br />AMIR: [in-video] Fire! There's a fire in here! Somebody please press the emergency brake! I swear to God, there's a frickin' fire in here!<br /><br />AMIR: And it worked! ...Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, except finally when someone does press the emergency brake, it just gives the gang that much more time to beat the shit out of you! ...That's not smart! ...That wasn't good thinking!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, but-- [scoffs] have you ever, like, gone to the gym and forgot your shoes?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Like, leaving my house, without my shoes--<br /><br />AMIR: Forget-- I knew you wouldn't get it--<br /><br />JAKE: Of course!<br /><br />AMIR: I knew you would just hang me out to dry, because you love seeing me fail! Right? The Germans call it \"schadenfreude\". [chuckles] Americans do too! It's funny: we were enemies for so long, but we still use some of their phrases. C'est la vie! [chuckles] That's French, but you get the poi--<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, focus. Okay?

Eight people are carrying you to the front of the train right now, laying you at the feet of the woman that you robbed, making you not only return her phone, but... God, lick the bottom of her shoes, which... you almost seem too willing to do.<br /><br />AMIR: Kinky! [chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: It's not \"kinky\"--<br /><br />[Jake stops to turn his attention to the video.]<br /><br />JAKE: What the f-- ...they're taking out your dick?<br /><br />[Amir folds his sunglasses and puts them down.

Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't do this.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass.<br /><br />[Amir sits down beside Jake on the couch, holding a notepad. Throughout the episode he sounds out-of-breath to the point that his voice is raw or cracking.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay! Ever heard of a get rich quick scheme? Well these are wet bitch thick creams; ninety-nine ways guaranteed to get us paid ASAP! [laughs maniacally]<br /><br />JAKE: So they are get rich quick schemes.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: You said they were \"wet bitch thick creams\"--<br /><br />AMIR: \"--ick creams\", yeah! [laughs] Okay, number one--<br /><br />JAKE: What is wrong with you right now? Don't yell; catch your breath.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Asshole.<br /><br />AMIR: What if we sell gift certificates that you have to accept at any store?<br /><br />JAKE: That's just money.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, exactly! We sell cash, for pennies on the dollar! [rubs his fingers together]<br /><br />JAKE: That means you lose money.<br /><br />AMIR: But ya gain pennies! [rubs his fingers together again]<br /><br />JAKE: You have to chill out, okay?<br /><br />AMIR: You know how people love juices and smoothies and shit?<br /><br />JAKE: I guess.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, so we get a paperclip, put it in a smoothie, drink it, die, and sue the Jew that sold it to us!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not where I thought you were going with that--<br /><br />AMIR: Well keep up, Jakey! 'Cause my mind's racing at m--<br /><br />[Amir stops, chokes, and coughs up a lot of blood into his hand. Then he begins laughing.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God! T--<br /><br />AMIR: [as trying to speak over Jake] Okay, okay, okay--<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not talking.<br /><br />AMIR: --why rob people-- why rob people, when you can change your name to Robert People? [extends his hand] \"Hi, I'm Rob People! Pleased to meet ya!\"<br /><br />JAKE: How does that get you money?<br /><br />AMIR: \"D'ahh, don't call me that; call me Rob! Mr. People's my dad's name.\" [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't call you anything.<br /><br />AMIR: Why don't me and you, we open up a frickin' pottery store, huh? How's that sound? Some choice pieces at first, but then we'd build up our inventory, start franchising some stores?<br /><br />JAKE: How is that a get rich quick scheme? Sounds like that would take years.<br /><br />[Amir puts his hand on Jake's shoulder.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's the first smart thing you've said today.<br /><br />[Amir has his arm around Jake so tightly that he's pressing his cheek against Jake's shoulder.]<br /><br />JAKE: Don't touch me, dude. I'm dead serious right now.<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you this out-of-breath, by the way? I mean, like... you look like you just ran a ten-K.<br /><br />AMIR: I'd like to run a 401(k)! Your frickin' retirement fund for a price, but first, [pats Jake on the stomach] how'd you like to open up a pottery store with me?<br /><br />AMIR: Ever heard of a nutritionist? Well I'm an oldtritionist! Pay me to eat a weed!<br /><br />JAKE: That cannot be on your--<br /><br />[Jake glances at Amir's notepad.]<br /><br />JAKE: --list. There it is. \"Pay me to eat a weed.\"<br /><br />[Amir is coughing large amounts of blood into a tissue.]<br /><br />JAKE: You okay, man?<br /><br />[Amir nods.]<br /><br />JAKE: You want me to call a doctor?<br /><br />AMIR: Call a doc-- Call a lawyer! I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!<br /><br />JAKE: That's actually really smart--<br /><br />AMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis! [laughs] I knew you'd shit on it! [laughs] Isn't your face redder than a beet! ...Speaking of beets, [puts his arm around Jake] do you got a garden? I'd love to eat a weed.<br /><br />[Amir is slumped down on the couch, holding the bloodstained tissue.]<br /><br />JAKE: Want to take a break?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, great idea. Let's take a-- let's take a hard five, go outside, get some fresh air, come back in here with a renewed sense of purpose to tackle the second half of the list--<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I'm gonna take you to the hospital--<br /><br />AMIR: Please do, [chuckles] 'cause at this point in time, I believe that I am, uh...

Amir goes to take a sip of his apple juice, but notices the intensely awkward silence and makes a face defensively. Jake and Streeter avert their eyes from Amir and each other.]<br /><br />AMIR: [now speaking very quietly, almost under his breath] How is that any... different...<br /><br />[Streeter stares down at the table in silence. Jake quietly spits out the food he was chewing onto the plate in disgust. Amir scoffs.]<br /><br />AMIR: [still quietly] Oh my God...<br /><br />[Jake stares daggers at Amir. Streeter puts down the sandwich he had been eating for lunch. He folds his glasses up and buries his head in his hands.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Yeah? You can't--<br /><br />[Streeter shakes his head. Amir scoffs again.]<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] ...What?<br /><br />[Amir makes a gun shape with his hand, points it at his head, and pantomimes shooting himself. Jake nods and mouths \"do it\". Amir looks dejected, and halfheartedly attempts to chuckle. Streeter is still sitting in silence, and Jake pats Streeter's shoulder to console him. Amir attempts to do the same, but Streeter swats his hand away and then gets up and leaves. Amir and Jake are left at the table together.]<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] You think that's... appropriate?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Boiling hot spum\"?<br /><br />END",

Amir enters and sits down.]<br /><br />AMIR: You're driving down the road; make sure to pay... the scroll!<br /><br />[Amir unrolls a very thin, fragile-looking scroll. Jake doesn't react.]<br /><br />AMIR: I got the cure for the common scroll!<br /><br />[Jake still doesn't react.]<br /><br />AMIR: Stop being such an ass-scroll.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I'm trying this new thing... where I ignore you, to see if that makes you--<br /><br />AMIR: [reading from the scroll] \"Top ten ways to celebrate this country's birthday, AKA: the Fourth of Julay!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please not read to me from that flimsy, shitty little scroll?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number ten:\" [Jake shakes his head] \"sit in a den! With the lights real dim by the couch that you're lying, nobody can tell that your eyes have been crying.\"<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about? Are you sad?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm not sad! I'm devastated! \"Number nine: laying supine! You're flat on the floor, calling your mother a whore through a more-than-locked door! Tears pour down my cheek because news flash: I'm weak!\"<br /><br />[In the background, Paul can be heard yelling at Will (see Jake and Amir: Password)[1] . Amir looks up from his scroll, and he and Jake look around for the source of the commotion.]<br /><br />PAUL: Enough. Enough, enough! Leave this office!<br /><br />WILL: I can't! I can't, I can't!<br /><br />[Jake turns his attention back to Amir.]<br /><br />JAKE: Are you okay?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm more than okay! I'm devastated! \"Number eight: the food's been great! I don't mean to get rambly, but why don't you just have a barbecue with your fambly?\"<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. You know what? That one's nice. Stop reading the list. I responded to one; I'll follow it--<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number seven: whoa, have a nice time in Heaven! You thought that burger was bison? Nah. That burger was ricin! With a patty this thick, it can sedate a family of sick! And mamma mia, I've dumped a bottle of Visine in the sangria! Clear eyes, full farts? Can't booze!\"<br /><br />JAKE: You absolute monster, you're talking about poisoning your family.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number six: I can fix this. '911? My dad's real sick! He's OD'd on Visine; it's the worst case that I've seen! Ohhh! You'll send an ambulance? That's perfect! Oh, what's my address? Sorry, motherfucker, you'll have to guess! Yeah!'\"<br /><br />JAKE: You depraved lunatic! Okay, you're talking about calling an ambulance in front of your dying family, and then not giving the EMT team the directions to your house? You'll-- you'll go to jail for that! I think you'd go to jail for even writing that!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh no! Jail! Well, I have a plan that won't fail. \"Number five: 'Keep me alive! I don't want your death penalty, Your Honor! It was a simple mistake! Does your yard need to be raked?'\"<br /><br />JAKE: Great, so your \"plan that won't fail\" is to publicly bribe a judge, [Amir grins smugly as Jake speaks] in a court of law, with a task that could easily do himself?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number four: 'This yard work's a bore! I don't wanna do this chore!'\"<br /><br />JAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three:\"<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit...<br /><br />AMIR: \"...fireworks for me! Head down to the local docks and watch the red, white, and blue o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Our ancestors fought, bled, and even died for this country, and the least we can do is take a moment to celebrate their effort, to cherish what we have. Even if life isn't perfect-- you know, 'cause let's face it, whose is?-- just sit down and reflect. You know, you can make anything you want for yourself, and that's what America is; that's what makes it the greatest country in the world!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. ...Okay!<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number two: take a poo. Right down there on the docks that you've been reflecting on, too! George Washington, you dreamy, dreamy oaf. Now lay down, open your mouth, and swallow my steamy, steamy loaf.\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...I think you need to die.<br /><br />[Amir makes a confused face.]<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Excuse me?<br /><br />JAKE: It's been six years, and you're getting worse. Okay? I think the world would just be... an infinitely better place if you weren't in it.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, [chuckles feebly] uh, \"number one--\"<br /><br />JAKE: No. You shouldn't be allowed to breathe.<br /><br />[Amir sits in silence, obviously hurt. He smiles weakly at Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: [choking up] Please let me finish.<br /><br />JAKE: Please finish your life.<br /><br />AMIR: You're upsetting me, dude--<br /><br />JAKE: Be dead!<br /><br />AMIR: [choking up] Uhhh, whoa-- [sobs, grabs his chest] --something's happening. I can't even-- I don't even know if I can finish the list at this point, because I am [sobs] short of breath or something! [sobbing, stammering] What d-- what d-- what d-- what did you do with this-- you put some weird, like, hex on me or something--<br /><br />JAKE: No, you're just crying.<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] No, I'm more than crying! I'm like-- [sobbing to the point of hyperventilation] I don't know! It's indescribable, I'm like... [breaks down]<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, well then you're sobbing.<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] No, n-- what is that? What is sobbing? I'm like-- [sobs] --scared-- [sobs] --and-- [breaks down again]<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, why don't you just go home, okay?<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] I can't go home; I think-- I think I'll die in the subway, I'm like-- [sobbing uncontrollably] ...what did you do to me? You witch doctor!<br /><br />JAKE: Just because I made you cry, you think I cast a spell on you?<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] Yeah! That's exactly what it is! You demon! You sorcerer! What is this black magic--<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, I was kidding, alright?<br /><br />[Amir immediately stops.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh... thank gosh.<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit.<br /><br />AMIR: That was...<br /><br />[Amir, shaken and seemingly lost for words, can't finish the sentence. Eventually he picks the scroll back up and resumes as if nothing had happened.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"--have fun in the sun...\"<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />END",

I need a password that you're gonna forget when you walk out of this office!<br /><br />WILL: Sir?<br /><br />PAUL: Well-- say I use Veracity8, and then I write a scathing email to my wife about what a baboon my assistant is.

I believe these dragon lilies capture not only her essence, but also her spirit.\" [Amir takes a swig of milk] \"They're a tad bit on the pricey side, but she was more than worth it.\" And then the link is a Rickroll.<br /><br />[Will walks up, in tears.]<br /><br />WILL: You monster.

It's just different.

You said you were a political activist rising up against this see something, say nothing bull sheeite. A mix between Che Guevara, Bam Margera, and Dom Irrera. And then you said \"I'm part of the sixty-nine percent.\" And when nobody laughed, you started crying.<br /><br />AMIR: Do you know what that means?

You already ashamed me.<br /><br />AMIR: Raise your hand if you think I have social issues!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, can you really not just sit still?<br /><br />JAKE: I told the officers you had a personality disorder, and they almost let us go but then you stole a billy club and hit a policeman in the shin with it. You said \"Score one for the Hurwitz brothers! If you don't like our power, take it from us with brute force.\" That's when we were both tased.<br /><br />AMIR: Why are you rehashing this shit? Alright, I was there.<br /><br />JAKE: I know you were there.<br /><br />AMIR: So you don't have to repeat it okay, just move on!<br /><br />JAKE: Ok, fine, I'm-<br /><br />AMIR: MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON! (People on the bus start to chant) MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON!<br /><br />JAKE: HOW CAN YOU START CHANTS THIS EASILY?",

Sorry.<br /><br />[Jake is at his desk. Amir approaches with his arm around Michael Fink, leading him towards Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: [singing reverently] Make way, for Shia the Beef! [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey--<br /><br />AMIR: [speaking, but still maintaining a tempo] Hey, you! Clear the way! It's an A-list star! Yes, you! Out of the way, it's an A-list star!<br /><br />JAKE: You just rhymed \"star\" with \"star\"?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm just flustered because I'm around a frickin' celebutante! Yeah, Shia the frickin' Beef, in the flesh! You're looking at a quadruple-threat, motherfucker! [begins counting down on his fingers for emphasis] Film star! Movie star! TV star! And guess what? [makes a popping sound with his mouth] He's got an Instagram!<br /><br />JAKE: Does he really?<br /><br />AMIR: Not yet, but you're looking at a social media team, [gestures to Mike and himself] and you'd better believe that's top-notch number-one priority.<br /><br />JAKE: You know you have an actual job here, right?<br /><br />AMIR: Not for long!<br /><br />JAKE: You're probably right-- also, how does having an Instagram make him a quadruple-threat?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't even know why I'm talking to you right now! You're sitting in the king's throne! Up, or off with your head!<br /><br />JAKE: This is my desk.<br /><br />MIKE: [pointing behind himself] I can sit over there...<br /><br />AMIR: No! Nonsense, sir! And I'm really sorry you have to see me like this, but please, Jake! Immediately! Get the fuck up! This is Shia the fuckin' Beef!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I think you actually like when he sees you like this. I think you get off on it, 'cause you act this way every single time Mike Fink-- by the way, not Shia LaBeouf-- comes to the office.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Mike Fink\", right? \"John Doe\"? Okay? We don't have to use alii. We're friends here, and Shia, by the way, you're not foolin' anyone, okay? I can smell Megan Fox's naked box on your bated breath, and guess what? [imitates cunnilingus with his fingers] It tastes good!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't tell me what to do; only one person can tell me what to do, and he's standing right here. [points to Mike]<br /><br />MIKE: Yeah, you really shouldn't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: Then I won't.<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you think he's Shia LaBeouf? Why do you think that?<br /><br />AMIR: Chia the frickin' Bean! Get it right or pay the price.<br /><br />JAKE: You're mispronouncing it.<br /><br />[Will suddenly appears and runs up to Mike.]<br /><br />WILL: Excuse me? Mister LaBeouf? I know it's not my place, but could I trouble you for an autograph?<br /><br />MIKE: ...Sure...<br /><br />[Mike takes Will's marker, and writes \"MIKE\" on his paper. Will grabs the paper excitedly and runs away.]<br /><br />AMIR: Now do you believe me?<br /><br />JAKE: What, 'cause Will asked for an autograph?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: That guy eats his own shit.<br /><br />AMIR: Low blow!<br /><br />JAKE: How so?<br /><br />AMIR: Hell no! Shia, please! Enlighten the man!<br /><br />MIKE: My name is Mike, and I'm not a celebrity.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Wow! [pause] Ever humble, even though this motherfucker starred in Holes, then went on to fill up Megan Fox's holes! I'm serious, dude! You gotta tell me about that shit! I want the deets! I have such a crush on her.<br /><br />JAKE: This is so inappropriate for work!<br /><br />AMIR: Wow, Jake's never been to Hollywood, Nollywood, nor Bollywood. And it's clear to me that Megan Fox jumped on your jolly wood, and rode that dolly good!<br /><br />JAKE: Will you please let Mike work?<br /><br />AMIR: I will! And I'll help him work; in fact, I want to be your Johnny Drama and your Turtle. If there's anything you need, I'm your man. I might be a vegetarian, but tonight... I'm eating Beef!<br /><br />JAKE: You're not a vegetarian.<br /><br />AMIR: That's actually a good point: we should release a sex tape.<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say that.<br /><br />AMIR: No no no, something tasteful at first-- you know, a little kissy-kissy, a little anal-- and then, when people aren't ready for it, boom! We hit 'em with the big one! We're viral!<br /><br />JAKE: What's tasteful about kissy-kissy and then going to anal?<br /><br />AMIR: Kissy-kissy! [makes kissing noises] Kissy-kissy!<br /><br />JAKE: Anal.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Oh.<br /><br />JAKE: If anal is tasteful to you, what's \"the big one\"?<br /><br />[Will walks up behind them with brown smears around his mouth.]<br /><br />WILL: Uh, sorry, could I get a selfie?<br /><br />[Will holds out his phone to take a picture of himself with Mike.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, Will, what were you eating?<br /><br />WILL: Uh...

My nose is bleeding.<br /><br />JAKE: It's always bleeding.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, but this time it's, like, for real!<br /><br />JAKE: [rapping in a low nasal voice] Ass so frat, we sat at the frat, we back to the frat, we sat on that ass, we back to the frat!<br /><br />AMIR: What are you doing?<br /><br />JAKE: I got a bid! ...That's what I'm doing!<br /><br />AMIR: What's a bid?<br /><br />[Jake holds up a paper reading \"Congratulations on Your Bid to Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon, Jake Hurwitz\", decorated with an emblem for YYY as well as a pattern of skulls and crossbones.]<br /><br />JAKE: A bid is a ticket! A ticket in! I'm a goddamn Greek god now. Okay? I'm pledging a frat.<br /><br />AMIR: Why are you pledging a frat?<br /><br />JAKE: First of all, can you not do me the disservice? Don't do me the dishonor, the disrespect of calling it a \"frat\"? Okay? It's a fraternity. Would you call your country a cunt?<br /><br />AMIR: My country's a cunt.<br /><br />JAKE: Traitor!<br /><br />AMIR: You called it a frat first!<br /><br />JAKE: Did I? Did I for real though? [suddenly nervous] ...Don't tell my Bigs. Do not-- dude, I'll suck your dick.<br /><br />AMIR: Stop it.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I will.<br /><br />AMIR: I know. Stop it!<br /><br />JAKE: Secondly, being in a fraternity is the highest form of brotherhood. It gets you made, paid, and-- oh yeah!-- it gets you laid.<br /><br />AMIR: How does it get you paid?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Sorry?<br /><br />AMIR: How does it get you paid?<br /><br />JAKE: It gets you laid, I said.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you said paid, and made--<br /><br />JAKE: Made.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Paid.<br /><br />JAKE: P-- You know what? It gets you paid in pussy. Yeah. That's what it does. Liquid pussy. That's currency in my frat. Okay? My fraternity. You got that? Have you ever hooked up with a sorority girl?<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: Well you know what? Pretty soon, that's something you and I won't have in common.<br /><br />AMIR: Isn't there, like, hazing and stuff?<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit, you really don't get it, do you? Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon doesn't believe in hazing, okay? They believe in the bond, forged by brothers, committing acts of courage for one another.<br /><br />AMIR: So what did you have to do?<br /><br />JAKE: Eat socks, chug a bottle of absinthe 'till I puked, get whipped on my ass, wear a vibrating dildo around my neck for an entire day, call my mom, tell her my brother was dead, call my brother, tell him I was gay, and me and a bunch of other pledges had to hold each other's dicks in a basement while we walked around like elephants. It's called the elephant-walk and, uh, this elephant wishes he could forget. [chuckles] I also ate six banana peels--<br /><br />AMIR: Jesus! Why?<br /><br />JAKE: Because I'm not allowed to question why! Because our bond is tighter than the glue they used to seal my asshole shut before our Triple Chili Challenge. Okay? Because Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon is a global... brand!<br /><br />[Jake holds up his arm. \"YYY\" has been branded onto his bicep.]<br /><br />AMIR: Holy shit!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah!<br /><br />AMIR: Did that hurt?<br /><br />JAKE: Still hurts! Hasn't stopped hurting! It's a third-degree burn, brother! But, um, I can think of something hotter! It's a sorority girl's ta-tas! And-- they're on my ya-ya!<br /><br />AMIR: Why, why, why!<br /><br />JAKE: [slaps the brand] Why not?<br /><br />AMIR: No, I was just reading it. Y-Y-Y.<br /><br />[A beeper on Jake's desk vibrates.]<br /><br />JAKE: Shit! Dude, that's Dick-Tooth. Give me your phone, quick!<br /><br />AMIR: Why don't you just call him on your phone?<br /><br />JAKE: 'Cause Dick-T threw it in a river!<br /><br />AMIR: You mean Dick-Tooth.<br /><br />JAKE: No! It's two different people, ass! Give me your phone, or I can kiss my bid goodbye!<br /><br />[A member of the fraternity, presumably Dick-Tooth, shows up.]<br /><br />DICK-TOOTH: Holy shit! God damn, Hur-bitch! I thought you was dead! I beeped you, and I got nothing back!<br /><br />JAKE: [standing at attention] It is I: Hur-bitch. I am your humble servant; you are my proud master.

[chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: I feel bad for you.<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is chugging a water bottle. He wiggles his eyebrows at Jake, who's watching him disinterestedly. Amir swishes the water around in his mouth.]<br /><br />JAKE: Swallow it.<br /><br />[Cut back to Amir, who now has water droplets on his shirt.]<br /><br />AMIR: Want to know a cute little life-hack? [wipes his mouth] If you're interested.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm actually not interested. And that was very foul.<br /><br />AMIR: It'll save you time and money, let alone effort, and... did I mention c-c-c-c-c-c-cash?<br /><br />JAKE: You did when you said \"money\".<br /><br />AMIR: Every time I fly, when I land, I'll pen a little complaint to the airline that flew me. You know, I'll come up with something like, uh, \"oh, they denied me a drink\", \"oh, the food wasn't vegetarian\"-- whatever miscellaneous hogwash pot-pourri comes to my crazy brain-- and like clockwork, within a business day, they're reimbursing me with a fifty-dollar voucher, a hundred-dollar voucher. I can sell that on the secondary market.<br /><br />JAKE: You absolute ass.<br /><br />AMIR: And proud of it!<br /><br />JAKE: You jerk.<br /><br />AMIR: Stop it! [laughing weakly] Okay? A-- a \"thank you\" would have sufficed, for saving you time, money, effort, and let alone c-c-c-c-cash!<br /><br />JAKE: How does it save me time or effort? It costs both of those things, and you know, for most people this involves overcoming some kind of moral obstacle.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I'm not most peoples!<br /><br />JAKE: You say that like it's a good thing; it's a very bad thing. Alright? You're endangering people's jobs.<br /><br />AMIR: Enda-- no, more than endangering! I've actually taken a pilot's wings before. I mean he wasn't fired, as it were, but he was definitely forced into an early retirement! I'm actually locked into litigation right now, so I can't speak with too much more detail about what's going on. [chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: What's going on?<br /><br />AMIR: We're nine months deep and I do not have the capital to sustain this frickin' Law & Order: SV-Fuck-U! I have been grilled by several expert witnesses and a lot of professional cross-examiners, and I'm just sitting under oath, lying through my teeth at this point! [laughing] I actually broke twice! Yeah, I couldn't even keep a straight face. My own lawyer left the courtroom mid-testimony.<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus!<br /><br />AMIR: It is a shit-show! I'm so heavy in debt, but nobody wants to take this on pro-bueno! Seriously, I'm two million in the hole, and at this point I have to win the frickin' case just to break even! How is that normal? How is that fair?<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? It's fair because it's all your fault! You did this to yourself; you're-- ...dude, you're robbing airlines!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, they rob us.<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't. Please.<br /><br />AMIR: No, have you-- have you seen these fares? They're gouging us!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't turn this into some kind of noble cause, okay? You're incapable of having an idea that big.<br /><br />AMIR: Have you seen Erin Brokovich?<br /><br />JAKE: You're a small-time crook.<br /><br />AMIR: Have you seen Erin Brokovich?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, I've seen Erin Brokovich, and you know what? She brought a small town to its feet and a corporation to its knees. You, sir, are no Erin Brokovich.<br /><br />AMIR: [finishing his thought undeterred] Well I'm Erin Choke-a-bitch!<br /><br />[Jake stares at Amir. Amir holds his final pose for a very long time for emphasis.]<br /><br />JAKE: Stand up.<br /><br />AMIR: [continuing to hold still] What?<br /><br />JAKE: Stand up. I think I need to fight you.<br /><br />AMIR: Why?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah! Uh--<br /><br />[Jake stands up, clearly not accustomed to fighting but driven by rage nonetheless. Amir stands as well.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...put up your dukes, I guess!<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know if I want to. This is ridiculous!<br /><br />JAKE: I know it's ridiculous, but I think it's finally come to blows, man.<br /><br />AMIR: I can't hurt you! I can't punch you!<br /><br />[Jake punches Amir in the stomach. Amir reflexively punches back, and connects with Jake's face.]<br /><br />JAKE: Aaah! Ass!<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry!<br /><br />[Jake winds up and hits Amir in the jaw. Amir swings his foot around to connect with Jake's leg. Amir also punches Jake, but still seems shocked at his own actions. Jake punches Amir in the face. Jake punches Amir in the face again. Jake punches Amir in the face a third time. Jake winds up a final time and hits Amir in the throat. Amir falls to the floor and struggles to breathe.]<br /><br />AMIR: [gasping] You a-- [gasp] You assh-- [gasp] oh--<br /><br />[Amir's phone rings. He answers it.]<br /><br />AMIR: [gasping] Hello? ...What? ...No, no-- Esquire, sir, with all due respect, that pilot touched me!

Mean-spirited, small-minded, homophobic, hateful, slanderous, thoughtless, careless--<br /><br />AMIR: \"P--\" okay-- \"Peru: P.U.\" [waves his hand in front of his nose] And, uh, \"Brazil: you can--\" [flips cards] \"--go to hil.\" ...\"go to hell.\" Okay, feel free to not hold your applause to the end.<br /><br />JAKE: They're not doing that.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Nicaragua: I need more agua.\" ...So.<br /><br />JAKE: You know that's Central America, not South.<br /><br />AMIR: It's south of America, and I urge you to stay silent until I'm done.<br /><br />JAKE: You just urged everyone else to applaud.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Jamaica, mon: how 'bout you make a mon?

Don't make me regret traveling with you.<br /><br />JAKE: I regret it. And you know, by the way, we're not actually traveling together. I went on a work trip, and when I got to the airport I went to baggage claim and you came out inside my duffel bag. Coiled up in there with two dislocated shoulders, nearly frozen to death.

This is fun. Just two best friends watching hotel television together. [chuckles] We both cherish this shit.<br /><br />JAKE: Nope.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my God, congratulations! It took you thirty seconds for you to make me feel like garbage-trash today! That's a record!<br /><br />JAKE: It was, like, three seconds.<br /><br />AMIR: And the shit just keeps on... [points to his gums]<br /><br />JAKE: \"Gumming\"?<br /><br />AMIR: That's right! [flips the remote in the air] Diva! [smacks Jake with it]<br /><br />JAKE: Ow.<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, let's go swimming.<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Hot tub?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on! Traveling with you is such a bore. What do you do, just sit inside of your room and jerk off all day? [pauses, shrugs, then pulls out his iPhone and moves his hand toward his pants]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, my God! Are you kidding me? [grabs the iPhone]<br /><br />AMIR: So we can't even spank it?<br /><br />AMIR: Can I hold the remote now?<br /><br />JAKE: You can't hold the remote, because last time you did, you ate one of the batteries.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, here we go, it's story time! Hey children, gather 'round; it's time for Jake to tell us a tall tale! Please, Jake, remind me what happened next!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? I will remind you, because you were blackout drunk! You put a battery in your mouth, you washed it down with an entire bottle of vodka from the minibar, and then said, \"I'll take that free ride to the ER now!\"<br /><br />[Amir flips the bird with both hands.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Hey, room service? Yes, can I get two cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad, and can you take that entire order and shove it up your butt? That's right: go fuck yourself! You've just been Punk'd by Ashton Coutchard! Ha, I wouldn't eat your pig slop if you forced me to butt-chug it!<br /><br />JAKE: You know they can tell what room you're calling from, right?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, bullshit. They did say 228, but I guarantee that's a lucky guess. [on the phone] Yup. Jake Hurwitz speaking.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, when the doctors X-rayed you, they found more than one battery. They found five or six AA's, a nine-volt, and an entire roll of copper wire.<br /><br />AMIR: It's electric!<br /><br />JAKE: That's the terrible joke you made on the operating table to deafening silence, as the nurses sawed into you.<br /><br />AMIR: Boogie-woogie-woogie. [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: You should be dead.<br /><br />AMIR: Enough! Absolutely no more!<br /><br />AMIR: [flipping channels] Garbage, fake news, reality trash, propaganda, propaganda, the weather channel... Skinemax? [stops flipping and moves his hand to his pants again]<br /><br />JAKE: No! [pulls Amir's hand away]<br /><br />AMIR: You really are becoming a thorn in my side.<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Room service? Hi. Yup, room 228-- no no no no no, don't hang up, that was-- my boy got a hold of the phone earlier, and you know how kids can be. Anyway, we would actually like to order lunch this time. Do you guys have, like, a small seaweed salad? Maybe like a quinoa starter of sorts that you could just roll up into, like, a... like a torpedo and shove up your ass? Like, just shove it up your goddamn ass? [laughs] That's right! My name is Jacob Penn Cooper Valerie Blumenwitz and you were just the victim of a Jerky-Boys-style stunt, AKA a flash mob!<br /><br />[Amir has his butt up in the air. He farts noisily.]<br /><br />AMIR: Did you Instavideo that?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass!<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Hello, room service? No no no, I'm sorry, please, no no, don't hang up, don't hang up. That was my brother. He's going through these-- I actually am calling to apologize. He's going through this, like, pha-- it's not even worth getting into. We actually-- I know this is hard to believe, but we really do want some food. I feel like the boy who cried wolf, but if you can just find it in your heart to-- to believe me one last time, I really w-- I'll make it worth your while. I'll pay you 200 percent. [pause] Gosh, thank you-- thank you so much. I so-- I so, so much appreciate it. [Jake buries his face in a pillow] I don't have a menu on me, but if you have, like a-- any spaghetti dish, like a pasta, like a penne vodka, something tomato-and-cheesy, that you can shove up your ass! That you can shove up your goddamn ass! [laughs] Hello? Hel-- oh my God, you gotta be kidding me! That's like the third time they hung up on me!<br /><br />[There's a loud knock.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my God, dude, dude, dude, you gotta get that.<br /><br />AMIR: [off screen, crying] Please, please, please! I'm so sorry for prank-calling the hotel! You really- I don't know what got over me, but you can't kick me out! You really cannot kick me out! I deserve to stay here! You don't understand, this is like a vacation for us; this is like a once-in-a-lifetime frickin' thing--<br /><br />JAKE: Just apologize!<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] I'm not going to apologize; it was a joke!<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] Got 'em.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Got 'em\"? Really?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: You just cried in front of a hotel clerk for thirty minutes 'til he got bored and left.<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone, still crying] Hello, room service? Yeah, can I have, like, a soup, and can you shove it up your, your goddamn-- yeah, your goddamn ass. Thank you. [to Jake] They would. They said they were going to.<br /><br />END",

We already found our leading lady.<br /><br />JAKE: Well yeah thanks again, and could you just let the next person know that we're ready?<br /><br />LIZ: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: We gotta go through the whole dog and pony show of at least seeing everybody, but I assure you it is more than a done deal I think we can all agree. Promise us you'll keep monday open?<br /><br />LIZ: Uh, I have a doctor's appointment.<br /><br />AMIR: Cancel it. Sweetheart. Please. Okay? You're as healthy as a clam.

I'm serious, how does it feel like?<br /><br />JAKE: Bad english bud.<br /><br />GIRL 2: Excuse me?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious. I musta been to like, what, a million of these?<br /><br />JAKE: You never come to these.<br /><br />AMIR: And I've only ever seen one person ever have it, as much as you currently do. Okay? And uh, Elisabeth Shue turned out alright.<br /><br />GIRL ON COUCH: What?<br /><br />AMIR: I want you to walk out. Walk out right now with your head held high because you just won a goddamn beauty pageant and a talent show all in one. (Singing) There she goes, Miss Americ-NO. That was... What was that? NEXT!<br /><br />PATRICIA: Oh wow, so that's why they call it the blues.<br /><br />JAKE: Great. Thanks. Bye.<br /><br />AMIR (Speaking too loud): Not another goddamn step you beautiful bombshell bitch.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, you Jessica Rabbit meets Jessica Biel A-list (bleep). Patricia? Do me a favor. Remember this moment. Can you do me that solid? Can you remember this moment? Can you remember this time and place? Can you remember what you see and feel? Okay? Because this is the last second of your life that you are in a goddamn A-list fucking (bleep).<br /><br />GIRL ON COUCH: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. I want you to take the scenic route home. I really do, I want you to waltz downstairs, go to the book library, the food store, whatever the FUCK it is you do, and I want you to soak in (inhales deeply) breathe in that privacy for the last FUCKING time, because after this week, after the people see what the performance that you just gave to us for the first time, and honestly, I feel treasured that I got to see it first, your life, as you know it, is completely changed, and I don't think everybody can handle it but I really think you can. Because honestly? You're a goddamn Elisabeth Shue to me. She is. Like I know I've said it before, but like, now I actually mean it. Thank you.<br /><br />PATRICIA: Did I get the part?<br /><br />JAKE: Maybe, not necessarily. We're gonna call you.<br /><br />AMIR: You more than got the part! You got our hearts. Namaste.

Please, can you not tell every single girl that they got the part? Because we're the ones that have to call them, and tell them that they didn't. Besides, I wrote Elton John Blows Papa Smurf, okay? You shouldn't even be here.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />AMIR (Mumbled): Queen.<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: Nothing.<br /><br />JAKE: What did you just say?<br /><br />AMIR: I called you a queen. And you know what? Sure all these girls might not have all gotten the part, but you know what at least they felt like a star for half a minute. And yeah, they'll come crashing back to reality when you tell them the truth, but isn't it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?<br /><br />(All the girls outside start clapping)<br /><br />JAKE: Nope. Don't clap. He said it in a cool way but he couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />AMIR (Speaking to the girls outside): Good news guys. You all got the lead.

Salut.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry... what?<br /><br />JAKE: You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, haha! Sorry.<br /><br />JAKE: It's not a good thing, so. Right?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah yeah yeah, what were you saying?<br /><br />JAKE: It's a picture of Yosemite Valley at sunrise, you commented \"How is this Earth, and how is this porn.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Good question.<br /><br />JAKE (Still reading from Amir's comment): \"If you wanna blow your nut hair back, check my imgur account\" and then the link is a picture of you photoshopped, poorly by the way...<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, your face on Ron Jeremy's body's fucking a map of Africa. That's Earth Porn to you?<br /><br />AMIR: It's subversive!<br /><br />JAKE: It's definitely not!<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry. I had no idea you were a circlejerking diva, when were you gonna come out of the closet on that one?<br /><br />AMIR (At the same time Jake is speaking): Yeah, how long have we known each other that you weren't gonna, yeah, you weren't gonna come out to me? Come on, I'm your best friend, tell me that you're a diva.<br /><br />JAKE (At the same time Amir is speaking): Really? Really? That's how you wanna play this? That's how you're gonna do this? Everybody who thinks you're an asshole?<br /><br />JAKE: Everyone who thinks you're an asshole for posting mean comments and linking to porn? They're a circlejerking diva, and nothing's wrong with you?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Exactly right, I'm glad you see things MY WAY! My way or the highway!<br /><br />JAKE: Fred Durst?<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a loser, man.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, really?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know if you saw this, but it was trending quite worldwide on twitter, last week, this loser? Went dickless for Michael Chiklis. So. I don't know.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, I see that post. Picture of you from a webcam with your dick tucked between your legs? The text on top reads \"Saw every Michael Chiklis movie\" text on the bottom reads \"Went dickless for him.\" You posted it in a subreddit called Jake and Amir! You know I don't approve of that.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm a good guy greg.<br /><br />JAKE: You're absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: I am, I am a good guy greg.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a scumbag steve.<br /><br />AMIR (Way too angry): Shut the FUCK up! Shut the FUCK up with that!<br /><br />JAKE (Shouting to the office): Is this okay?<br /><br />AMIR: No, it's not! Take it back!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you also post a lot in explain it to me like I'm five. Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.<br /><br />AMIR: The comments were helpful, and I appreciated them.<br /><br />JAKE: How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote \"OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die.\"<br /><br />AMIR: To which I zung'd him back!<br /><br />JAKE: You wrote \"How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes.\"<br /><br />AMIR: To which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.<br /><br />JAKE: They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.<br /><br />AMIR: And counting!<br /><br />JAKE: You commented on his post \"I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime.\" Did you even set up an AMA for that?<br /><br />AMIR: Didn't need to.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!<br /><br />AMIR: You know what, enough. Okay? I already regret even bringing up the fact that I was gonna delete my reddit account because quite frankly at this point in time, I don't even see me having the huevos to pull it off! I really don't!<br /><br />JAKE: If you need a little encouragement, why don't you look at the front page. Where it says \"If this post gets ten thousand upvotes Amir Blumenfeld will kill himself.\"<br /><br />AMIR: And?<br /><br />JAKE: Got a hundred and fifty.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Thousand. Upvotes.<br /><br />AMIR: A thousand?<br /><br />JAKE: A hundred and fifty thousand. For you to kill yourself.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I know.<br /><br />JAKE: Like they want you dead. Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR starts crying<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. Of course. Yeah? A little tears?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Crying?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Sobbing?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Thirty years old though?<br /><br />AMIR: Uh huh.<br /><br />JAKE: Almost thirty one?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />AMIR: Am I really on the front page?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, it's on the front page but you-<br /><br />AMIR: My name?<br /><br />JAKE: Yup.<br /><br />AMIR: On the front page of REDDIT?<br /><br />(AMIR's crying turns into laughter)<br /><br />AMIR: A hah hah hah hah hah hah.

I fell into a deep fitfull rest, fevered nightmares of birds eating my face and what have you. But, listen up because this is when it gets real.<br /><br />JAKE: It hasn't already gotten real? You were clubbed in a van by a guy named Parm.<br /><br />AMIR: I shoot awake mid surgery, you know I guess the club (lifting leg again) didn't do the trick. Heh, anyway, long story... shart...<br /><br />(AMIR shits himself)<br /><br />JAKE: Shower, burn the chair.<br /><br />AMIR: I wake up in a cold, cold sweat to the sound of a bone saw cutting through by bone cartilage, nasal cavity deep deep deep into my skull and I'm like, you know what? No! Enough is enough! I take a scalpel, blind old Parm and I am out of there. Unfortunately, for me, I'm too weak, tired, scared and lame to get much further than the front of the inside of the van. Erstwhile, Parm is on in the back, rufflin' around, swearin' to the only Pagan god he believes in that he's gonna have my head in a jar for what I done to him, RE, blinding him with a scalpel.<br /><br />JAKE: Was it worth it?<br /><br />AMIR: Let me work it, ha ha.<br /><br />(JAKE shakes his head, AMIR whispers 'wow')<br /><br />JAKE: All this destruction.<br /><br />AMIR: It was nerf ifinifin when yet and you're not even cracking up-<br /><br />JAKE: This carnage...<br /><br />AMIR: Yup, a smile.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, was it worth changing your stupid nose over?<br /><br />AMIR: If you're talking about blinding Parm then you should know that he was nearly blind to begin with, okay?

And- by the way- why would you let a blind person operate on your face?<br /><br />(AMIR's phone rings)<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, speak o' the devil, He he.

What are your numbers?<br /><br />AMIR: Because you have a bias against me.<br /><br />JAKE: What are your numbers?<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse me?<br /><br />JAKE: What are the numbers? We'll check right now to see if you won. First ticket. Go.<br /><br />AMIR: What do you mean, \"first ticket\"? They're both the same \"winning\" combination on each ticket! Why win one lottery... [holds up three fingers] when you can win tree?<br /><br />JAKE: So you know what three is? Right? 'Cause that one's got three, this one's got two-- you know what? Forget it. You bought multiple lottery tickets with the same combination?<br /><br />AMIR: The same winning combination! [picks at his scabs] There's a difference.<br /><br />JAKE: There's not. What are the numbers?<br /><br />AMIR: 1, 18, 22, 27, 38, Powerball... tree! As in \"I just won the lottery tree times\".<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ, you won.<br /><br />AMIR: I know. I know.<br /><br />JAKE: Please, this isn't fair! Alright? You have to understand-- this is the most insanely lucky thing that's happened to anybody, ever.<br /><br />AMIR: Not luck, okay? Strategy!<br /><br />JAKE: No, it wasn't strategy! Okay? Just-- jump up and down, be happy, at least act shocked. Okay? You noseless ass!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, excuse me! What's that supposed to mean? Is that some kind of dig at my nose?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! Obviously! It wasn't thinly veiled!<br /><br />AMIR: I can't handle this right now! I gotta go back to the store and get the numbers on these tickets to match the one on the site!<br /><br />JAKE: Great, so they don't match right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Not right now! But I have a feeling if a guy who just won three hundred and thirty-three million dollars waltzed in there, [picking at his scabs] they'll pretty much do whatever the hell he asks them to.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please just focus on getting your face better and stop scratching your nose?<br /><br />AMIR: It just itches a lot, okay? But it's fine!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey-- hey, it-- but-- no, there's a family of spiders crawling out of there.<br /><br />AMIR: [with spiders on his nose] Oh my God!<br /><br />END",

What?<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is washing a bowl in a big metal bucket. His phone rings.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, can you get that?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh. Thank you! Ass!<br /><br />[Amir dries off one hand and picks up the phone.]<br /><br />AMIR: Hello? Hey! Hey, no no-- sorry, I was... I was washing a bowl. Oh! No, you're calling about the couch? Unfortunately, she's uh... she is no longer available. Alright. Thank you. Thank you so much for calling. Bye, hun. [hangs up, resumes washing the bowl]<br /><br />JAKE: You sold a couch?<br /><br />AMIR: No, no no, no, no-- [laughs] --it's actually a... it's actually a funny story--<br /><br />JAKE: Never mind, alright? I don't think I want to know.<br /><br />AMIR: Here's what I do: I, uh, put a nice leather couch up on Craigslist saying it's available for free to a good home. You know, I even peppered in some really believable details, like \"I'm moving; I don't have a place for it,\" et cetera, yada yada.<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Why\" what?<br /><br />JAKE: What do you mean, \"Why what\"? You just told me something really mean-spirited and weird that you do, so I asked you why.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! [laughs] No, I just, uh, I like to let people down. I like to hear people's disappointed voices, I guess. I don't know if that makes me weird or whatever.<br /><br />JAKE: Weird? It makes you borderline psychotic!<br /><br />[The phone rings again.]<br /><br />AMIR: Shit... can you get that?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not gonna answer your phone.

Alright, well my first question is usually \"Why do you want the couch?\" ...Oh, your daughter's going away to college and she really needs a good couch? [laughs] That's really sweet. [whispering, to Jake] Watch this! [on the phone] Unfortunately, the couch is unavailable! Yes, it is because of how you answered the question. [laughs] No, no, I'm not being cute with you, uh... you really-- you disappointed your daughter on this one. Alright. Okay. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye then. [hangs up, resumes washing the bowl]<br /><br />JAKE: She asked if you were being cute with her?<br /><br />AMIR: I told her I was being \"cheeky\".<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't. I'm sitting right here. That's not what you said.<br /><br />AMIR: I said that. I said I was being cheeky.<br /><br />JAKE: You suck. You really do. You suck; you're not a good guy.<br /><br />AMIR: God forbid I have some fun at work!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! God does forbid this! Your reverse prank-calling people, and your fucked-up bait-and-switch with these evil mind games. Using a work phone, by the way! You don't even have the Goddamn courtesy to use your cell phone?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, because I don't want people to know my personal number!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, I get that, but you shouldn't be spending this much time and effort just to piss people off.<br /><br />[The phone rings. Amir grunts in frustration, then points at Jake expectantly.]<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you think I'll answer it? [Amir puts the bowl back in the bucket] The bowl's clean.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass! Ass! Ass!<br /><br />JAKE: You are.<br /><br />AMIR: [picking up the phone] Hey! Oh my God, speak of the devil! Mickey, my friend!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: You're in my apartment, Mickey, right? Alright, you rented a U-Haul, Mickey, the biggest one? You got past my doorman, Mickey? You found the key that I left under the floor mat, Mickey? Okay, open the front door to my apartment, Mickey, and you will find a tastefully distressed, beautifully restored, Danish, modern, touch of class for your ass-- there is no couch, Mickey! [laughs] It was all a mind game, Mickey! A fuckin' riddle, Mickey.<br /><br />JAKE: You know what, that's not a riddle, and did you do one work thing today? Did you answer a single email? Why'd you bring that bucket--<br /><br />AMIR: Mickey! Mickey, Mickey, Mickey... no no, you have to get out of my apartment, Mickey. Okay? I'm sorry, but you are officially trespassing, Mickey, and I have a good mind to call the police about it.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you left him a key. That's not exactly trespassing.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh. Oh! Oh God, Mickey-- No no no, I can hear-- Oh, I can hear you breaking stuff, Mickey! Please... Mickey, Mickey, I'm begging you, no no no no no-- Ohhhh God, that was the sound of my plasma TV against the tile floor, Mickey! What are you doing, Mickey? Don't do anything you can't take back, Mickey. Oh, Mickey, I'm begging you.<br /><br />JAKE: You say \"Mickey\" so much when you talk to him, it's crazy.<br /><br />AMIR: [still pleading] Mickey!

I ate with Jake, I ate with Jake, I ate with Jake, and I don't care who knows it!<br /><br />JAKE: I do. I care who knows it. And you know what? We didn't even eat breakfast together. I was in line at Starbucks and you stood behind me eating loose egg salad out of a plastic bag!<br /><br />AMIR: [pauses, then bursts out laughing] I love that! Breakfast club is nothing if not ribbing on each other! [still cheery] Cool it with the name-calling though, 'cause I'm secretly depressed about that kind of shit.<br /><br />JAKE: First of all, I didn't even call you a name just now. Second, you're not secretly depressed about anything. You're outwardly depressed about it.

Excuse me, but I have a deviated septum about that kind of shit! Where does she get off calling me that, that-- that queen, that diva, that roach?<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you think she said \"hum\"? By the way, you name-call a lot, for someone who doesn't like it.<br /><br />AMIR: [still humming] I hate it when it's used on me. I like it when it's used on other people... dillweed!<br /><br />JAKE: No, I know! I'm just pointing out how hypocritical you are-- close your mouth-- okay?

Hey, it's a new record, bud!<br /><br />JAKE: Look how fast you turned on me. How quickly you went from happy to sad. [Amir is suddenly happy] From calm to angry. [Amir is suddenly angry again] Is that normal?<br /><br />AMIR: [humming] Maybe.<br /><br />JAKE: I don't think it is. I think you should just try to be nice, and quiet, for five minutes in a row. Right now.<br /><br />AMIR: And then you'll take me to lunch?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Fine. If you're quiet for five minutes, I will take you to lunch.<br /><br />AMIR: You're on.<br /><br />PAT: Sorry, uh-- did you... want to know about my dad, still?<br /><br />AMIR: Quiet, dork!<br /><br />JAKE: You lost it, Hum.<br /><br />AMIR: [slowly being drowned out by his own nasal hum] Noooooooo!<br /><br />END",

Amir comes in with a paper package and an umbrella.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's not raining outside.<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, check this out. I, uh... made my own bread last night?<br /><br />JAKE: Are you asking me a question?<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly out of breath] Yeah, I just figured, uh, why not? [unwrapping and holding up a loaf of bread] I've been, uh, interested in that... kind of thing for a while now, so... ta-dah!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow... okay. [gives a thumbs-up] Nice, bud.<br /><br />AMIR: [still out of breath] Yeah, last night for dinner, I was, uh, jonesing for, like, a grilled cheese sandwich, you know. So I open the door and I just see, like, uh, cheddar?<br /><br />JAKE: Just make them sentences instead of questions. Statements, okay? [Amir nods] You're telling me a story; you're not asking me.<br /><br />AMIR: And I had, um... [pause] tomatoes?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Did you have it or not? I don't know.<br /><br />AMIR: I had tomatoes?<br /><br />JAKE: Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: But hey! No bread, so I, uh...

I actually am just not that hungry.<br /><br />AMIR: [sawing the bread loaf] Come on, please? It'll mean a lot to me if you... try a slice!<br /><br />JAKE: No, I know it would mean a lot to you. That's one of the reasons I don't want to try the bread.<br /><br />AMIR: [still sawing] I'm curious to see what you think about it.<br /><br />JAKE: I wish you were less curious.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding the bread off the table, still sawing] Whether you like it or not is actually what I'm most curious about!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, of course. I know.<br /><br />[Amir finishes cutting a slice of bread. He hands it to Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: Here you go. Careful, it is hard.<br /><br />[Amir drops the bread, and it makes a clanking sound.

Really hard.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.<br /><br />JAKE: This is chalk!<br /><br />AMIR: That is uncalled for! It is chalky, to be sure, but there are some redeeming characteristics.<br /><br />JAKE: No, like this bread is legitimately chalk! I mean-- [pulls out a chalkboard, draws on it using the bread] --look!<br /><br />AMIR: Enough! More than enough, actually, okay? There's constructive criticism, and then there's this-- this-- this-- this-- this poison that you say to me...<br /><br />JAKE: This bread is poison!<br /><br />AMIR: Do you like it... or not?<br /><br />JAKE: Like it? I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!<br /><br />AMIR: Appreciated!<br /><br />JAKE: Never a compliment.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam! [Handing Jake a plastic container with a live rabbit sitting in it] Yeah! Just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread. [laughing] Now you have me saying \"chalk\", ya dingbat!<br /><br />JAKE: How?<br /><br />AMIR: No-- I don't know how! You said \"chalk\", and then suddenly I'm saying \"chalk\" instead of \"bread\". It's a whole thing.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?<br /><br />AMIR: It is jam! You just press its head against the bread-- not chalk mind you-- [laughs] and then you use a knife to sort of squeeze its little jam insides out of its anus onto the cha-- [pause] bread, oh my God, I hate you!<br /><br />[Jake stares, dumbfounded, at Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: Here! Here! Give me that-- give me that rabbit jam. I'll show you.<br /><br />JAKE: No!

Yeah, you know, not everything has to be more than something, just to drive your point past home.<br /><br />AMIR: You're gonna put me on blast for that?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah. A blast.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh? That's a good idea?<br /><br />JAKE: I do. I think so.<br /><br />AMIR: To blast me?<br /><br />JAKE: Blast you on a Tuesday.<br /><br />AMIR: On the day I move to The Angels?<br /><br />JAKE: I'll help you with your stuff.<br /><br />[Jake grabs the box. It folds instantly, as the bottom hasn't been put together.

You have no possessions?<br /><br />AMIR: No possessions? There's a sandwich bag!<br /><br />JAKE: A s-- yes! Exactly! You have a sandwich bag! You worked here for eight fucking years!<br /><br />AMIR: It's odds and ends, mostly!<br /><br />JAKE: It's really light! You know, considering the amount of time you spent here, at this desk. No backpack? No bag?<br /><br />AMIR: I pack light.<br /><br />JAKE: You didn't pack at all! You packed-- [shakes the bag] --it sounds like grapes and raisins, mostly.<br /><br />AMIR: [grabbing the bag] Enough, alright? Enough.<br /><br />JAKE: Right. [pointing to the OZENENZ label] \"Odds and ends\", by the way, is not one word. You, uh... you spelled this more than wrong.<br /><br />[As Jake and Amir walk away, the focus lingers on their desk.]<br /><br />[Jake is accompanying Amir on his way out. They are in the elevator.]<br /><br />AMIR: It's been ace working with you.<br /><br />[Jake pauses, but Amir begins talking over him the moment he responds.]<br /><br />JAKE: Man, that was lame. It was so lame. It made me uncomfortable. / AMIR: Ass, ass, ass for not laughing at that? It was a callback!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay.

What are you talking about? Just 'cause I'm gonna be in LA doesn't mean that we're not gonna work together anymore!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it does.<br /><br />AMIR: How frickin' so?<br /><br />JAKE: How not? You're moving across the country. You're gonna be in a different office.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] I know! But we're still gonna be in the same office... dweeb!<br /><br />JAKE: [also yelling] So you don't know! I just said we're not gonna be in the same office! Don't yell at me that you know when you don't!<br /><br />AMIR: Congratulations! Time! You just ruined my last day on Earth here in six minutes flat? No! Six minutes bumpy!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm trying to tell you that I'm gonna drive you to LA.<br /><br />AMIR: In what?<br /><br />JAKE: [pointing to an RV parked across the street] In that.<br /><br />AMIR: ...What is that?<br /><br />JAKE: It's an RV!<br /><br />AMIR: We're driving across the country in an RV?<br /><br />JAKE: Eight days of adventure.<br /><br />AMIR: Just you and me?<br /><br />JAKE: Just me and you.<br /><br />AMIR: [taken aback] Wow... [to himself] I deserve so much more than... [trailing off]<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] I deserve so much more than this! This-- this... this is your big idea for a send-off?<br /><br />JAKE: ...You piece of shit.<br /><br />AMIR: Cool it.<br /><br />JAKE: No!<br /><br />AMIR: What is that, like, a... like a thirty-footer or some little piece of--<br /><br />JAKE: It's twenty-two feet.<br /><br />AMIR: Twe-- you might as well have rented a minivan at this point! I'm not going Dutch with you on that!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not asking you to go Dutch-- you know what? Never mind, man. Just have-- have fun in California.<br /><br />AMIR: No, no no no, come back, come on, yeah, I'm excited. Big adventure. Hurrah.<br /><br />JAKE: You're making it worse.<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? No no no, this is good. You'll make it up to me along the way.<br /><br />[Amir heads off-screen toward the RV.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh sheesh, y'all! 'twas a road trip!<br /><br />[Off-screen, there are tires squealing and horns honking.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh!<br /><br />AMIR: [off-screen] Whoa!

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] Viva... Las Jake and! Amir! Damn it.<br /><br />JAKE: Bad execution. Bad idea.<br /><br />AMIR: Keep it rolling!<br /><br />[Amir is in a bathtub in a fancy hotel suite, where a bikini-clad girl is massaging his shoulders. Jake comes in.]<br /><br />AMIR: I woke up in a used Bugatti!<br /><br />JAKE: We have to leave!<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse us.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, actually, you know what? Excuse us. Can me and Amir talk alone for a second?<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa! Anything you can say in front of me, you can say in front of Kat!<br /><br />LYDIA: Uh, my name's Lydia.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry. [to Jake] In front of Kat!<br /><br />JAKE: Lydia.<br /><br />AMIR: Who?<br /><br />JAKE: You know what, forget it. You showed up on the casino floor last night, drunker than I've ever seen anyone.<br /><br />AMIR: I was blackout... with my cack out!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, it was. You were wearing a leather jacket, a French beret, and nothing else.<br /><br />[Amir lifts his crotch out of the water. He's completely naked.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: [disgusted] Oh! Warts!<br /><br />AMIR: No!<br /><br />JAKE: You jumped on the roulette table, instantly pulled your hamstring, but you decided to power through.<br /><br />[Amir smirks at Lydia.]<br /><br />JAKE: You said \"I'm the maitre d'! Who wants fish and chips?\" You pointed up at the rafters, like a weakling Babe Ruth, you pulled out a flounder or a... or a sea bass or something...<br /><br />[Amir is now wearing Lydia's shades over his glasses.]<br /><br />JAKE: You tossed a thousand dollars' worth of chips in the air, and you hit it across the casino floor like... l-- like you were, like you were playing Tee Ball or something!<br /><br />[Amir and Lydia laugh. Lydia is wearing Amir's glasses, and her shades are missing.]<br /><br />JAKE: Then, you tried to charge what you thought was the mound, and you ended up hitting an elderly Walmart greeter on vacation with her dying husband. Closed-fisted.<br /><br />AMIR: [wearing both glasses and shades again] Flounder!<br /><br />JAKE: I said flounder!<br /><br />AMIR: [wearing just his normal glasses] You said sea bass! ...Sea bass!<br /><br />JAKE: Security was called, but you were covered in fish grease, naturally, so you were able to slip through their arms. The pit boss announced a rousing game of \"catch the slimy Jew\", and a group of Asian businessmen bet against you, and won, when you ran full-speed, head-first into a Sex and the City slot machine.<br /><br />AMIR: That was a classic Samantha move. I'll admit it. I'll be the first to admit it!<br /><br />JAKE: There was a deafening crack, [Amir pulls a face] and everybody started to surround what they were sure-- what they hoped, actually-- was a dead body...<br /><br />[Amir is wearing the glasses and shades again.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...until you awoke mid-sentence, suing the casino, which I guess is when they upgraded you to this ridiculous suite.<br /><br />AMIR: [with normal glasses] Thus concludes your tale of woe and worry, but alas, everything worked in the end! [picks up a handful of bubbles] Bubble bath! Bubble bubble bubble bath. [blows them at Jake]<br /><br />JAKE: No it didn't! Security took you up here and started showing you suite after suite, but it was clear that you had taken this... miraculous turn of events for... more than granted! You kept on claiming \"none of these rooms are Mac Daddy enough!\" Finally, in this one, you demanded to know whether the balcony was stable or not. When the concierge went out there, you locked the door behind her...<br /><br />[Amir smirks at Lydia, who is wearing his glasses.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...and then, in a final brazen act of cowardice, you tried to set the room on fire. Unsuccessfully.<br /><br />AMIR: [with his normal glasses] Except I burned my finger, okay? If I may be so bold as to ask: how is that fair?<br /><br />JAKE: That is a bold question, but it is actually not fair, because in a fair world, you would be dead.<br /><br />AMIR: You don't have to be a roach about it!<br /><br />JAKE: Finally, delirious with anger or maybe possessed by the devil, you barrel-rolled down the escalator back onto the casino floor, in nothing but an open bathrobe and a cowboy hat. You yelled \"I'm gonna buy a blood diamond worth of blow! Who's coming back to my room with me?\"<br /><br />[Amir blows more bubbles toward Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: That's when Lydia-- who, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her: Lydia, I can only assume you're a garbage-can whore-- came back up to the room. By the way, honey, there's no blow up here. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, but--<br /><br />[Lydia jumps out of the tub and begins strangling Jake.]<br /><br />LYDIA: What did you say? [to Amir] You promised! [continues screaming at Jake]<br /><br />JAKE: What? [to Amir] You said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her!<br /><br />AMIR: Kat! I said you could say anything you wanted to in front of Kat! That's Lydia! She's a feisty one. This [gesturing to another bikini-clad girl showing up] is Kat!<br /><br />KAT: Did you say something about Lydia, motherfucker?<br /><br />[Kat begins yelling at Jake and choking him as well.]<br /><br />END",

I put on sunglasses and you put on like the exact same pair.<br /><br />Amir is wearing a similar pair of glasses<br /><br />AMIR: Not the, (laughs) not the exact same pair. Your's are yellow right? I can't, yeah they're yellow right?<br /><br />JAKE: It's like the idea of putting on sunglasses.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh- the idea-<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake sitting looking at the sunglasses:<br /><br />AMIR (O.S.): I didn't- yeah I didn't know you invented sunglasses.<br /><br />Jake puts the glasses down and pulls out a small video camera tape, written on it is:<br /><br />ACE AND JOCELYN<br /><br />ASTRONAUT<br /><br />ACCOUNTANTS<br /><br />FROM OUTERSPACE!<br /><br />EPISODE 5<br /><br />CUT TO: Clip from 'Ace and Jocelyn - Episode 5':<br /><br />Jake is pointing his finger at Amir<br /><br />JAKE (to Amir): This right here?

Put it down!<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake taking out a box of Chicken McNuggets:<br /><br />Jake opens the box and eats a nugget<br /><br />AMIR (O.S.): All day, every day...<br /><br />CUT TO: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Nutrition':<br /><br />Amir is sitting at his desk eating a chicken nugget<br /><br />AMIR: ...every hour, got a chicken nugget in my pocket gotta put it in my mouth.<br /><br />Jake and Sarah are sitting at Jake's desk<br /><br />SARAH: Jesus, where did that- where did that even come from?<br /><br />JAKE: He just has them.<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake looking through the bag:<br /><br />Jake pulls out a Rubik's cube<br /><br />JAKE (O.S.): So do you want the Rubik's Cube?<br /><br />CUT TO: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Rubik's Cube':<br /><br />Amir is sitting at his desk<br /><br />AMIR: Only if you want me to solve the Rubik's cube. THAT depends on whether or not...<br /><br />Jake throws the cube at Amir. It hits him in the nose. Amir clutches his nose<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake playing with the cube:<br /><br />Jake accidently drops the cube and it shatters off screen.

But it's a reminder for me to not be such a bitchly. I'm a little ashamed about it but I keep it on.<br /><br />JAKE: Listen to your voice.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't let it get to that octave.<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake throwing the badge down:<br /><br />Jake pulls out a gold watch<br /><br />JAKE (O.S.): This is a Rolex!<br /><br />CUT TO: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Rolex':<br /><br />Jake is sitting at his desk holding up the watch<br /><br />JAKE: It's a Rolex, buddy!<br /><br />AMIR: You know how you're always like, uh, 'what time is it?'

I'm sorry for that that was obviously a little too much. [Simultaneously] JAKE: You just yelled cunt in the office. How is that okay? Alright, you know what?<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake pulling Amir's canyon note out of the bag:<br /><br />JAKE pulls the note out which says:<br /><br />FUCK OFF JAKE!!<br /><br />YOU RAT COWARD!Jake sighs and returns the note. He gets up and walks away<br /><br />In the new LA office boardroom. Employees are standing around chatting. Amir enters.<br /><br />AMIR (singing): Make way, for prince Amir...<br /><br />The employees start booing and throwing paper at Amir. Someone pulls a chair out from under him and he falls down. Everyone cheers and laughs. Someone helps Amir up and then spits in his face before another employee staples his neck<br /><br />AMIR: Ow! Ow!<br /><br />Jake runs in<br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Hey! Come on! What are you guys doing? This is insane, it's no way to treat somebody on their first day of work. I mean I know you've heard stories about this guy from New York, but, but jeez doesn't he deserve a chance? He took a real big leap of faith coming out here and... the least you guys could do is give him a fresh start. (Looking at Amir) I know one guy in this office who will.<br /><br />EMPLOYEE 1 (coughing): Loser!<br /><br />EMPLOYEE 2: Nice!

This is insane!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! A Rubik's cube.<br /><br />Amir starts fake crying<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, shut the fuck up. Alright, tell you what man, the RV is outside!<br /><br />AMIR: Enough.<br /><br />JAKE: I can move back to New York.

IT? Yeah, this is Jake Amir Blumenfeldwitz from the fifth floor? [lifting an old printer onto his desk] I have a brand new, heavily used 1982 Inkjet printer!<br /><br />JAKE: How is that brand new?<br /><br />AMIR: Brand new ink! [on the phone] Sorry. [to Jake again] Brand new ink! Okay? Yeah, the cyan was replaced last week, but the yellow and magenta are butt-old!<br /><br />JAKE: So then the ink's not brand new either.<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] That's right, I desire to connect. So why don't you come upstairs and hook a printa up!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, there's a lot of mouse droppings in there.<br /><br />AMIR: That's right!<br /><br />JAKE: What do you even need to print?<br /><br />AMIR: Travel much?<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: Boarding passes... asses! Or do you check in curbside!<br /><br />JAKE: When is the last time you flew?<br /><br />[The IT guy shows up.]<br /><br />IT GUY: Hey, if you want to print, just select the default printer from the server here.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, okay, yeah, connect to your server? So you can jack my shit, jack my boarding passes?<br /><br />JAKE: Come on.<br /><br />AMIR: [chuckling] Soon you'll be... spending cross-cuntinental trips on my dime? Wh-wha-what, Christmas in Maui? Easter in Hanoi? Arbor Day in the Thimble Islands, all care of Dr. and Mrs. Blumenfeld!<br /><br />JAKE: How is that your dime, then?<br /><br />AMIR: [to the IT guy] Let me ask you a question, good sir, now that you're here...<br /><br />[He hits a key, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger soundbite plays.]<br /><br />ARNOLD: Who is your daddy, and what does he do?<br /><br />IT GUY: This is a company computer.

I'll connect the printer.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, watch out, dude.

[long pause] Someone absolutely has.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding his cheek] To strike me like you did showed a lack of tact, and you came off like a classless ass, and that's the facts, Jack.<br /><br />JAKE: For as dumb as you are, you're pretty good at rhyming.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, I appreciate your attempt to mediate and alleviate what you've done to me to date, but it's a little... too little too late.<br /><br />[Amir is tucking his head between his legs, and straining to move further forward.]<br /><br />AMIR: [grunting] Come on, you little pussy! Get... ah! Aw, shit!<br /><br />AMIR: Fill out a bracket, huh? I say fack it! Nah!<br /><br />JAKE: \"Fack it, nah\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, fack it.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah? You wanna say \"fack it\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Fack it! Nah!<br /><br />JAKE: Then get out! ...Why don't you get out? Leave! You say \"fack it\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: Right?<br /><br />AMIR: Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: You want to--<br /><br />[Amir is forcing his head between his legs again.]<br /><br />AMIR: Fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: Let's get high. Right now. I swear, my picks will make more sense if we're baked!<br /><br />JAKE: Well, they couldn't make less sense currently. You have in your final four Gonzaga, a picture of a porcupine, the number eleven, and jam.<br /><br />[Jake dabs his finger on Amir's bracket, coming away with a smear of jam. He tastes it.]<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, enough-- Hey! No eating! ...No cheating!<br /><br />[Amir has his head between his legs again. Jake is taking a picture of him.]<br /><br />AMIR: [grunting] Stop!<br /><br />AMIR: St. Louis, St. Joseph... what is this, a fucking, like, a... [laughs] ...I thought this... what is it, like, a-- a fucking... [making wild hand motions]<br /><br />JAKE: Wow, dude. Try to work on these jokes a little bit.<br /><br />[Amir has his head between his legs.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Time.<br /><br />AMIR: Damn it!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, dude, so you can't suck your own dick at all, let alone to completion, in less than three minutes.<br /><br />AMIR: Double or nothing, okay? Anybody else's dick. Any dick.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, stop it. Stop it. I win the bet.<br /><br />AMIR: [collecting his and Jake's brackets] Alright, so these are them.<br /><br />JAKE: That's it.<br /><br />AMIR: Our final brackets. Let me just file them under \"E\" for evidence! [rips the brackets up]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh-- come on!<br /><br />AMIR: Because you're under arrest! [grabs Jake]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, that type of shit might fly in NYC, but this is illegal gambling, alright? We don't look too kindly on rinks!<br /><br />END",

I post about these things pretty often, actually, they're-- [chuckling] --they're actually really funny! They're great! [laughing]<br /><br />JAKE: You just said you didn't like them, [looking down at his laptop] and wow. Buddy, you are a major part of the problem. Don't you think? You post about these stories all the time on Facebook! Your last one just says \"Buck Fieber\"... nice.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious, dude. Buck him! Yeah, why does he get all this attention? He doesn't deserve it! Just... just thinking about it, literally all the time, makes me sick to my stomach!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you're giving him a lot of attention.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, 'cause he's a basket case! He's a car crash, and I can't look away! Also, belieb it or not, I'm... I'mma kind of obsessed with this little fucker.<br /><br />JAKE: Of course I belieb that! That's very beliebable.<br /><br />AMIR: I have Bieber fever in a way. Okay?

You're w--\" ...you sound bad, dude!<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />[Jake is outside, writing and eating lunch. Amir and Murph come up behind him, wearing oven mitts and carrying a giant pot of pea soup.]<br /><br />AMIR: Who wants soup?<br /><br />AMIR/MURPH: April Fools!<br /><br />[Amir and Murph dump all of the soup on top of Jake, who lets out a blood-curdling scream.]<br /><br />[Cut to Jake lying on his stomach on a stretcher. His shirt is off, and his back is covered in cloth bandages. Amir walks over to him.]<br /><br />AMIR: I know you're not mad at me, okay, but I can't help but feel that you're a little bit pissed at the day.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm mad at you.<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa! Did not expect or deserve that tongue-lashing!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what I didn't expect or deserve? To be burned alive. Leave me alone.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine!<br /><br />[Amir stops talking, but doesn't leave. He looks around idly for a bit, then bends over and puts his face next to Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: Want to know the worst part?<br /><br />JAKE: I know the worst part. It was the feeling of the flesh falling off my back, after--<br /><br />AMIR: It's that April Fools is like ruined now almost. [standing back up] Not in a good way, either.<br /><br />JAKE: How can you ruin something in a good way?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm just saying that I feel like every April you'll be reminded of this little snafu, and I won't be able to play another epic prank on you without this green cloud hovering over us!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you know what, dude? I think I will remember this every April. I'll remember this every week, every day, for the rest of my life. I will never forgive, never forget--<br /><br />AMIR: Today just got sucks.<br /><br />JAKE: Today got sucks when you scalded my back with soup.<br /><br />[Murph shows up.]<br /><br />MURPH: 'Sup, Jake. ...Making Amir feel bad again?<br /><br />JAKE: Leave me alone, Murphy!

Why?<br /><br />[Murph stands up, and rips one of the bandages off of Jake's back.]<br /><br />JAKE: [screaming] Owwwww, I'm sorry!<br /><br />MURPH: [leaning over] I don't think Amir could hear you.<br /><br />JAKE: [whimpering] Ohh...<br /><br />MURPH: Because you were yelling like a bitch.<br /><br />AMIR: I guess kinda I could hear him...<br /><br />JAKE: [high-pitched stammering] Yeah, he could hear me! Hear that? He said he could hear me!<br /><br />AMIR: ...though Murph does raise a good point that it was a little bit masked by, b-- by the, by the bitchly screaming.<br /><br />MURPH: So let's try that again, Jake. [Jake whimpers again] This time, without the bitchly screaming.<br /><br />JAKE: Weak! I'm so--<br /><br />[Murph tears another bandage off.]<br /><br />JAKE: [screaming, crying] Owwwwwww!<br /><br />MURPH: Amir, do you accept that?<br /><br />AMIR: I mostly do, but maybe not completely, because he didn't finish the sentence. He was like, \"I'm sorr-- aaaaah!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Man, this is so fucked! Even for you guys! ...It's too dark! I don't like this!<br /><br />MURPH: Amir, should we give Jake one more chance to apologize like a man... [leaning down to Jake] and not scream like a bitch?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't want him to get hurt--<br /><br />JAKE: Good, man! You hear that? He doesn't want me to get hurt!<br /><br />AMIR: --though, on the other hand, everybody does deserve a second chance, and maybe another rip will give Jake that opportunity.<br /><br />MURPH: [to Jake] Everyone deserves a second...

I feel no pain. What are you doing?<br /><br />MURPH: [smiling calmly] I'm applying warming jelly to your back. Jake, the soup wasn't burning hot... it was freezing cold. [Amir nods] You went into shock, and... we told you your body was covered in third-degree burns. [staring off into the distance, still massaging Jake] It's funny, you know?

[As he speaks, he tries to put his arm around Jake, but Jake keeps fighting him off.] We're currently inside a five-bedroom, six-bathroom colonial townhouse, in Williamsburg, Virginia.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, can you stop doing that? We're not in a townhouse.<br /><br />BEN: Okay, that's my fault. It's the wrong listing. [flipping through listings] Aaah!

Haaaaaakuna matata! Nothing happens. That's just to scare it, to get ready. Cut to seventeen hours later: I'm in my bed, shittin' my balls off. Moving on!<br /><br />BEN: I shouldn't tell you this--<br /><br />AMIR: Oooooh, do it--<br /><br />BEN: Okay, fine! Do you want to know who lived here before you guys?<br /><br />JAKE: Sure.<br /><br />BEN: Have you heard of a little band called the Rolling Stones?<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, yeah.<br /><br />BEN: Well, the serial killer who lived here loves the Rolling Stones.

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Who needs Jake? [laughing, then crying] Where is he?<br /><br />[Jake is in an office room, on his phone. Amir materializes from nothing into the chair beside him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh hey there!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ, dude!<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: What are you?<br /><br />AMIR: Been thinking a bit about poster ideas; thought I could run a few by you.<br /><br />JAKE: Poster ideas.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't you think we're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point?<br /><br />AMIR: I think I can make 'em funny!<br /><br />AMIR: We should come up with a ratings system. So instead of you saying, like, \"this is good, this is bad\", you'll be like \"this is amber, this is taupe\".<br /><br />JAKE: So taupe is bad?<br /><br />AMIR: No no no, taupe is great. Amber is just better than that, and if something is ultimate, it's gray.<br /><br />AMIR: It's a poster of Jordan, right-- Air Jordan, probably-- and he's soaring through the sky and slammin' it home! [putting his hand on Jake's shoulder]<br /><br />JAKE: Stop touching me.<br /><br />AMIR: Pretty--<br /><br />JAKE: Pretty unoriginal.<br /><br />AMIR: Pretty forcefully. Is what I was gonna say. Don't taint my ideas with your negative shit feedback... Christ!<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, it's a poster of dank weed, you know, like sticky bud, and there's, like, a girl in a bikini.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright. Taupe.<br /><br />AMIR: Pretty good. Agreed.<br /><br />JAKE: That's the lowest I could rate it.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh?<br /><br />AMIR: [taps Jake's shoulder] Alright, it's a poster of a clock, right--<br /><br />JAKE: Don't touch me.<br /><br />AMIR: --but instead of the hour marks, it's little beers... except at six o'clock, it's a little ears. 'Cause listen up! It's beer-thirty! And I'm thirsty!<br /><br />JAKE: That's the only time that it wouldn't be beer-thirty. It would be ear-thirty.<br /><br />AMIR: Amber.<br /><br />JAKE: ...How dare you.<br /><br />AMIR: See if you can wrap your twat around this one: it's a psychedelic black-light poster for a little band I like to call... the Grateful Dead! [pulls a constipated-looking face]<br /><br />JAKE: That's a really horrible face-- and none of these ideas have been original, okay? It sounds like you want to just open up a poster store.<br /><br />AMIR: That's actually a pretty dece idea. Maybe a poster store in the front, a cool cafe in the back, and a little spot to put air in your tires if you ride a bike!<br /><br />JAKE: God, you're a bad businessman.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm not a businessman. I'm a businesswoman.<br /><br />AMIR: It's a picture of a ninety-eight-year-old dude on a toilet, right? Caption: \"I'm gettin' too old for this shit!\"<br /><br />JAKE: That one's kind of funny.<br /><br />AMIR: Well that one already exists too! So all this shit about me not selling \"originals\"? [doing air quotes] \"You're dumb\"!<br /><br />JAKE: Why am I here?<br /><br />AMIR: ...What?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm actually on the fence about even pitching this one, 'cause it's so, like, hyper-offensive.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, well, so don't say anything--<br /><br />AMIR: But it's a [long-sustained bleep, accompanied by a black censor bar over Amir's mouth]<br /><br />[As Amir describes his poster, he makes violent hand gestures. Jake tries shushing him, then looks around, then tries to interject. None of this is audible over the censor bleep. Eventually Jake slaps Amir to shut him up.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Taupe.<br /><br />AMIR: So it's a poster so shiny and reflective that it shows you a mirror image of yourself when you stare at it.<br /><br />JAKE: A mirror.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say your name. You're pitching me a mirror.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Yes, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Taupe.<br /><br />AMIR: Dope.<br /><br />AMIR: I can has cheezburger?<br /><br />JAKE: Is that a pitch?<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm just hungry, and I was wondering if I can has a... has a cheezburger, actually. I... I hasn't has one in a while, and I was... simply... curious as to whether or not I can has one. A cheezburger.<br /><br />AMIR: This one's less of a poster and more of a drink, but it's like a... orange juice and soda water.<br /><br />JAKE: That's entirely a drink. You just pitched me orange soda.<br /><br />AMIR: I-- it's just that I'm starving, and I feel like I can has... a whole lot of food, but more than anything else, I... I cazn't has a cheezburger. In fact, I... I cheezn't has a cazburger in quite a while, factually.<br /><br />JAKE: I don't care what you eat.<br /><br />AMIR: I caz hoping I caz has one. With cheez.<br /><br />AMIR: It's called the Guide to British Smiles, and it's just famous Englishmen and pictures of their fucked-up teeth. It's like half social commentary, half me just being a little bit of a dickling.<br /><br />JAKE: No, you're just always being a dickling.<br /><br />AMIR: [mouthing] Wow. [writing]<br /><br />JAKE: Still wrote \"amber\".<br /><br />[Amir has a cheeseburger.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oooh, I shouldn't has this! I cazn't has this cheezburger! It'll give me bad cholesterol! I can has bad cholesterol?<br /><br />JAKE: I think you're has-ing a stroke.<br /><br />AMIR: This one's half poster, half beverage. Okay? It's called an Arnold Palmer!<br /><br />JAKE: That's all beverage. It's half iced tea, half lemonade.<br /><br />AMIR: Just tell me if you like it or not!<br /><br />JAKE: It's a good idea, but it's not yours.<br /><br />AMIR: Winning! [gives Jake a thumbs-up]<br /><br />AMIR: It's a 1988 Lamborghini Countach, parked on a hill during a sunset, cherry red! And guess who gets to drive it!<br /><br />JAKE: You?<br /><br />AMIR: Heck no! ...Me in ten years!<br /><br />AMIR: ...Milk?<br /><br />JAKE: God-- can I see your notebook?<br /><br />AMIR: You'll never understand my scatterbrain!<br /><br />JAKE: [flipping through the pages] Yeah, just page after page of drink ideas.<br /><br />AMIR: I can has my notebook back now?<br /><br />JAKE: You think you invented milk?<br /><br />AMIR: Dad?<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, just trying to organize my thoughts here. Would you say your top three choices so far have been psychedelic poster, milk, and mirror?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. That'll suit me well for my first round of funding; the angel round, as it were. By the way, how much could I put you down for? It's a big pie, so feel free to ask for a small little slice.<br /><br />JAKE: Zero.<br /><br />AMIR: That fucking hurts to hear.<br /><br />END",

Amir is driving. Amir looks over at Jake expectantly.]<br /><br />JAKE: Look-- [pointing at the road] ...Jesus.<br /><br />[Amir gestures at somebody outside.]<br /><br />AMIR: Learn how to drive, shitbird!<br /><br />JAKE: That guy's walking.<br /><br />AMIR: Call me a shitbird again. Call it to my face and see what happens.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! And last time I checked...<br /><br />JAKE: \"I'm have a pussy\"?<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] ...I'm have a pussy. Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you've said that before.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right. Can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? Alright? Music helps me drive!<br /><br />JAKE: Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry if music distracts me! I think that's pretty normal, actually.<br /><br />JAKE: Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.<br /><br />AMIR: [mocking Jake] I-- I--I know how to drive, alright? I'm a regular James Deen.<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Jerk.<br /><br />AMIR: I can't... you know what?... I can't see anything. I think I need my sunglasses.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--<br /><br />AMIR: No, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em.<br /><br />[Amir leans way back into the backseat to look for his sunglasses. Jake grabs the wheel.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, hey-- hey-- dude! Hey! Idiot!<br /><br />AMIR: I got 'em, dude! I g--<br /><br />JAKE: You idiot!<br /><br />AMIR: Why am I an idiot? Okay? There's a lot of glare. It'll be much safer if I just find my shades!<br /><br />JAKE: Eyes on the road, buddy.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't need 'em on the road, buddy! Alright? Relax. I--<br /><br />[Jake shushes Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] Beware, beware, beware...<br /><br />JAKE: Find the glasses.<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] ...of a woman with a broken fart! [farts loudly]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh! Smelly!<br /><br />[Amir sits back in his seat, wearing heart-shaped sunglasses.]<br /><br />AMIR: Got 'em, baby!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />AMIR: Pussy-whipped much?<br /><br />JAKE: ...What?<br /><br />AMIR: I swear, dude. You let women walk all over you. You gotta--<br /><br />JAKE: I don't-- ...stop it. Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay...<br /><br />JAKE: I don't feel like having a conversation right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. [pronouncing \"page\" in French]<br /><br />JAKE: Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. [pause] It's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive. [chuckles] Was sittin' in the same seat you were. If you can belee dat!<br /><br />JAKE: I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--<br /><br />AMIR: Cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. \"Loser has to teach Queen Dweeb to drive!\" That's what they said.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Queen Dweeb\"?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Queen Dweeb\". That was their nickname for me. They used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?<br /><br />JAKE: ...The pit?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. They used to throw knives at me.<br /><br />JAKE: Why did you ask me about peach pits?<br /><br />AMIR: Because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...Idiot!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah?<br /><br />JAKE: Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.<br /><br />AMIR: [doing an arm signal] I use arm signals. [sticking his arm in front of Jake] Hi-ya! Less legal, sure--<br /><br />JAKE: Eyes on the road.<br /><br />AMIR: --but... way less effective, too.<br /><br />JAKE: So you said \"less\" twice, then.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. [chuckles] Oh, God, these driving lessons. Daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. \"I don't want to drive today, Papa! I can't reach the pedals!\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...Excuse me?<br /><br />AMIR: I was four.<br /><br />JAKE: God, your parents suck, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse me! Say that again! Say that again to my face and I will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!<br /><br />JAKE: Keep your eyes on the road!<br /><br />AMIR: I can't see shit, dude! These glasses are not prescription!<br /><br />JAKE: Then take them off!<br /><br />AMIR: [leaning back into the backseat again] Let me put them back in the case!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Dude!<br /><br />AMIR: What, dude! Drive, shitbird!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Come on!<br /><br />END",

Amir has a pair of shears, and is trimming a large potted plant.]<br /><br />JAKE: So you're not even pretending that you do work for the company anymore?<br /><br />AMIR: Work is fun, but I've actually been pretty into hobbies recently, horticulture being the latest. I like... masturbating and shrimp quite a bit.<br /><br />JAKE: One of those is a hobby. The other is jerking off, and the third is just a sea creature.<br /><br />AMIR: Masturbating might actually be my favorite. [chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: Do we have, um... a hose?<br /><br />JAKE: Why don't you just do your work, for the day?<br /><br />AMIR: [pointing the shears at Jake] Sorry, can I ask you-- how much a week do you spend on produce?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't point the s--<br /><br />AMIR: [waving the shears wildly at Jake as he points] I'm serious. How much a week do you spend on produce?<br /><br />JAKE: Alright. Doesn't look like you have a good grip on the shears there, so don't-- [Amir drops the shears on his desk] yeah, don't gesticulate with them like that.<br /><br />AMIR: [picking up the shears, pointing them at Jake again] I really want to know, dude!<br /><br />JAKE: Ten bucks.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow! ...Really! That's... that's nothing! ...Where do you shop?<br /><br />JAKE: How much did you spend on gardening supplies?<br /><br />[There is a long, awkward silence.]<br /><br />JAKE: See, at this point, I know whatever you say is a lie--<br /><br />AMIR: Nine.<br /><br />JAKE: --'cause you spent--<br /><br />AMIR: Bucks.<br /><br />JAKE: --too long.<br /><br />AMIR: Dude.<br /><br />[Jake stares incredulously at Amir, who waggles his eyebrows at Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: You know what?

That's infected!<br /><br />AMIR: [emptying a bag of fertilizer onto his desk and laptop] Believe it or not, I'm actually growing the ingredients one would need to make a salad!<br /><br />JAKE: I don't believe that-- hey, man, that smells awful.<br /><br />AMIR: It's, uh, basil, ficus... manure...<br /><br />JAKE: ...Terrible salad.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. A lot of salads actually taste like shit, but I hear they're pretty good for you. Here, look.<br /><br />[Amir shoves a handful of manure into his mouth.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh, don't! Dude, no!<br /><br />AMIR: [through a mouthful of manure] This one tastes like horse manure, actually!<br /><br />JAKE: That actually is horse manure!<br /><br />AMIR: [with his mouth full] Sure tastes like it!

Now you got me sayin' it! [laughs]<br /><br />AMIR: You said it first!<br /><br />JAKE: Anyway, this is a snatch made in Heaven! Alright? Nineteen. Her name is Lod. [pronounced \"load\"]<br /><br />AMIR: Lord?<br /><br />JAKE: Lod. L-O-D. As in she has double-D's. It's French or some shit, and I'm going to french... [miming licking breasts] ...her tits!<br /><br />AMIR: I wonder if I should get Tinder!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm gonna stop you right there. I wouldn't do that, just 'cause you're what my Tinder coach would call an app-killer. You're someone who doesn't just get left-swiped; you actually inspire people to delete the app. [laughing] You're ugly.<br /><br />AMIR: Mean!<br /><br />JAKE: Sometimes the truth hurts. You've got to embrace it. I was an app-killer myself before I met Chet, but it only cost me fifty bucks per match to become Mr. Right-Swiped!<br /><br />AMIR: Loser! You have a Tinder coach?<br /><br />JAKE: Goddamn right I do.<br /><br />AMIR: How many matches have you gotten?<br /><br />JAKE: [holding up one finger] Just the one. Just the one so far, but I've only been right-swiping for a year.<br /><br />[Amir makes an incredulous face. Jake mocks him defensively.]<br /><br />AMIR: Long time.<br /><br />JAKE: The trick? Shirtless pics! That's right, a topless pic for this thick dick makes the chicks--<br /><br />[Jake gags.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh.<br /><br />[Jake gags again.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh!<br /><br />[Jake gags a third time.]<br /><br />AMIR: Why?<br /><br />[Jake vomits onto his desk. Amir watches in astonishment. Jake spits out the last of the vomit and continues.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...sick!<br /><br />AMIR: Holy shit. How?<br /><br />JAKE: [clearing his throat] I fingered a cat, dude! At a shelter!<br /><br />AMIR: Inhumane!<br /><br />JAKE: [wiping his mouth] I guess I'm just excited about my date with Lod tonight.<br /><br />AMIR: That's not a good reason!<br /><br />JAKE: With Lod.<br /><br />AMIR: Where are you taking her?<br /><br />JAKE: Get this, dude: I'm gonna meet her online.

So please, I beg of you, actually I demand of you, to proceed with reverence.<br /><br />AMIR: All--<br /><br />JAKE: Tread lightly. Fucker.<br /><br />AMIR: All these photos are of different strippers.<br /><br />JAKE: Meaning?<br /><br />AMIR: Meaning, this one's blonde. This one's a redhead. This one's Asian!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah! Lod keeps you guessing, man. That's why I dig her. Plus we really connected over chat! Things got real!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, she wrote \"Hey, cutie. Want to see me tonight? Go to livecamgirlwhores.co.nz and enter your billing info.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! I kind of like when girls ask for what they want. I think that's sexy. Maybe you disagree.<br /><br />AMIR: You responded \"I don't have a credit card. Can I PayPal or Venmo you? I think this could be the real deal, and I'd hate to lose you over a technicality, Lod.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry for me telling her what I want too!<br /><br />AMIR: She responds \"Sorry, cutie. No cash. Need billing info.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Fair.<br /><br />AMIR: You write \"Shit, shit, shit. Okay, calling my dad. Do not hang up, please.\"<br /><br />JAKE: I was worried about losing her.<br /><br />AMIR: She writes \"Don't worry, cutie. This is a text conversation. There is no hanging up.\"<br /><br />JAKE: She's there for me when I'm feeling weak.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright...<br /><br />JAKE: By the way, I resent the implication that I'm not good at texting. I'm a Casanova in that regard.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, you finally respond \"My dad yelled at me, but I cried, cried, cried, and my mommy was able to make things right by snagging a pic of Dad's CC.\"<br /><br />JAKE: There we go. Everything's right in the world.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Sending you some major coin as we squeak.\"<br /><br />JAKE: She deserved it.<br /><br />AMIR: She says nothing!<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't have to.<br /><br />AMIR: You write again \"I love you.\"<br /><br />JAKE: 'Cause I do.<br /><br />AMIR: She said nothing.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't have to.<br /><br />AMIR: You write \"I love you so much, Lod.\"<br /><br />JAKE: I do. I love her so much.<br /><br />AMIR: She says nothing.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't have to.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, 'cause then you said \"I'll see you tonight on the cam. I love you so much, Lod.\"<br /><br />JAKE: What don't you understand, dude? She's playing hard to wet!<br /><br />AMIR: She just wrote back \"Can't do tonight, cutie.\"<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: \"I withdrew a thousand dollars from the account as a holding fee for next week.\"<br /><br />JAKE: No...<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: No!<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Lod!<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Why, Lod?<br /><br />END",

Moira Slut.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, let me stop you right there. Uh, for anybody who's a little bit too thickheaded to get what's going on, Moira Cunt, at this moment in the script, is trying to... mask her true identity.<br /><br />EMILY: \"I say 'Moira Slut' because I'm masking my true identity.\"<br /><br />MURPH: Very good writing.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Moira Slut, why don't you get on your knees and kiss my knees?

Twenties, fifties, even sixties and seventies. It's all good because it's all green. It's that guap shit that makes rappers' hoes go 'da-na-na, na-na-na, na'. I'd punch my mother in the gut for twenty dollars.\"<br /><br />[As the scene direction is read, Jake and Murph have a silent argument. Murph stares incredulously at Jake. Jake gestures at Amir and mouths \"He wrote it!\" Murph gestures at Emily as if to accuse Jake. Jake mimes typing on a keyboard, gestures at Amir again, and mouths \"It didn't happen. He wrote it.\"]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay guys, try not to lose your cum, uh, when you read what happens next. I know scripts don't usually get this salacious, but this is the hottest sex scene I've ever written.<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] Sex scene! Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: It's clearly not a sex scene! We're not having sex!<br /><br />PAUL: \"Darryl and Moira Clock start going to town. They're going all the way. A salad bowl is on Darryl's head like a party hat. Moira wears an ape mask and nothing else, except a shirt and pants and grandma underwear.\"<br /><br />[Jake and Murph continue arguing silently. Murph takes off his glasses. Jake mouths \"Put your glasses on.\" Murph mouths \"No. No.\"]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, that's very hot. I might lose a little cum myself!<br /><br />MURPH: It's a little too hot, don't you think, Jake?<br /><br />AMIR: Who am I to deny this on-screen chemistry?<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] Off-screen chemistry!<br /><br />JAKE: [yelling] On-screen!

I'll sue you, dude!<br /><br />[Murph pins Jake against the wall and tries to lift him up. Emily licks her fingers and slips her hand under the table. Murph has Jake on the floor, face-down, grabbing him by the legs.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh God, my knees! My tiny knees!<br /><br />[Murph screams furiously.]<br /><br />END",

Business is booming!<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please not shake so much? Just contain the excitement. You enter every single conversation with an agenda, so, like, no matter what direction it goes--<br /><br />AMIR: Business is booming. I'm happy; you're happy for me! [laughs] I'm doing everything right now pro bono, but that doesn't mean I'm not makin' bank! [rubs his fingers together]<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it does! If you're using \"pro bono\" correctly.<br /><br />AMIR: I can't help it if my Yelp reviews suck!<br /><br />JAKE: That's one thing you can help! The reviews suck if you suck!

I believe the one you requested... [typing on his keyboard, winking to Jake] let me pull it up right now... is, uh... that's right! It's called \"I'm not actually DJing your daughter's wedding tonight, Mickey!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Here we go.<br /><br />AMIR: She's gonna be an ugly bride, Mickey, and she's probably not gonna get married, Mickey!<br /><br />JAKE: That has nothing to do with being a DJ.<br /><br />AMIR: You know why, Mickey?

Or do y'all only like to talk about unimportant shit?<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I think your sound system is unimportant shit.<br /><br />AMIR: [gesturing with the carrots sticking straight out from his palms] Really! Because last time I checked, audio was the second-most important part of the audio-video experience.<br /><br />JAKE: Worst hands ever; stop doing that-- so it's the least important part, right?<br /><br />AMIR: I just wish we'd talk about my hobbies too, but I feel like I can't even get a word in edgewise.<br /><br />JAKE: You're dominating the conversation! What hobbies do you even have?<br /><br />AMIR: Not really a hobby, but I'm pretty good at alienating significant others. Like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, I'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... I'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely. [chuckles] Box her out physically, just so she doesn't feel like one of us.<br /><br />JAKE: Why would you think that's even close to a hobby? It's the opposite of a hobby. A hobby's an enriching way to spend your spare time, and that's just... that's tearing at the fabric of a loving relationship.<br /><br />AMIR: At least we're talking about something!<br /><br />JAKE: We were talking about something.<br /><br />PAUL: [getting up] I'm gonna...<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, of course.<br /><br />[Paul leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: Can't handle the heat, huh?

You don't swallow early.<br /><br />AMIR: You don't have to tell me twice.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't bring an entire bag of carrots to lunch. You bring one or two.

You don't have the rights to either of those games.<br /><br />AMIR: Copyright infringement.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Exactly.<br /><br />AMIR: [humming the Mario theme] Doo-doot doo doot-doot doo! Doo! Jojo the Italian Plumberman.<br /><br />AMIR: Let me see your phone.<br /><br />[Jake slides his phone over to Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay.<br /><br />[Amir smashes Jake's phone with a hammer.]<br /><br />JAKE: Why.<br /><br />AMIR: What would you say if I told you I had a game that would fix this?<br /><br />JAKE: Do you?<br /><br />AMIR: Not yet.<br /><br />AMIR: Ninety-five percent of gaming happens when you're on the shitter. So this game is called \"Wipe Me\", and you get to clean your butt virtually.<br /><br />JAKE: ...As well as in real life, right?<br /><br />[Amir shrugs.]<br /><br />AMIR: Like, nobody thought to land on the Moon, and then one night, we were just there!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not how it worked. You thought we went to the Moon by accident?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm just saying let's do that, but with this fix-your-phone game!<br /><br />JAKE: Call tech support. Alright? Get my phone fixed.<br /><br />AMIR: Shut up about your phone for a second. I'm... I'm having an idea.<br /><br />[Amir is quiet, but peeing sounds are coming from under the table.]<br /><br />JAKE: I can hear you peeing.<br /><br />AMIR: You know how it's illegal to spy on people while they shit, shower, and shave?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes.<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly concerned] Really?<br /><br />[Amir covers his phone with his hand.]<br /><br />JAKE: Let me see your phone.<br /><br />AMIR: No chance in hell. That's an invasion of my privacy.<br /><br />JAKE: You're invading other people's privacy.<br /><br />AMIR: No I won't. Again. Or for the first time. I won't, and I didn't. And I haven't. Again. Or ever.<br /><br />[Amir can be heard peeing.]<br /><br />JAKE: That's a long piss.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm peeing. For a second.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! Not really a game idea, but--<br /><br />JAKE: Then I'm gonna stop you right there. It shouldn't be on this list.<br /><br />AMIR: --I shave a soul patch.<br /><br />JAKE: You're so scatterbrained. What do you do? You just sit around your apartment coming up with game ideas, when you have an idea for facial hair? You don't have to write down every dumb idea that comes into your mind!<br /><br />AMIR: And the truth finally starts pouring out!<br /><br />JAKE: I've said that. I've always said that.<br /><br />AMIR: [pounding his fist rhythmically against his chest, humming to the beat] Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, yeah...<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, so it's Spotify, but only for songs.<br /><br />JAKE: Spotify is for songs. Also, that wasn't a game.<br /><br />AMIR: Really? Because last time I checked, you play music.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Just my first critique then. Spotify's already for songs.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll put it in the \"maybe\" pile, then.<br /><br />AMIR: [still pounding a beat on his chest and humming] Hmm-mmm, alright, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, do it too...<br /><br />AMIR: Let me tell ya, I had a lot of time to come up with game ideas as a teen. I had facial backne.<br /><br />JAKE: You mean regular acne?<br /><br />AMIR: Nope, fbackne. I'm talkin' about back zits on my face. I wish I would've had acne. Acne would have been an improvement... acne would have been nice.<br /><br />AMIR: [still pounding a beat on his chest and humming] Two hearts beating as one, hmm-mmm...<br /><br />JAKE: Say an idea, or I'm gonna leave.<br /><br />AMIR: Parcheesi.<br /><br />[Jake shakes his head.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Yeah yeah, he just, uh, he just whacked it with a hammer, and it broke. [laughing] I know! I guess he-- I guess he thought he can fix it with an app, which I don't think you can do. Could you? If you w-- even if you dreamed big? 'Cause of the Moon landings. Okay. Yeah yeah. [to Jake] You're a moron.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Oops! All Long Pieces Tetris\".<br /><br />JAKE: That actually sounds pretty satisfying.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I don't have the ability or the rights to program it! Okay? So I'm kinda stuck there, aren't I. Don't say \"nice\", if you know for a fact I'm dead to rights.<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you pitching me anything?<br /><br />AMIR: I like lists. [rifling through his paper] In fact, can I pitch you a list of list ideas that I have?<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] No, no no, he'd be honored to be on your \"Idiots of Tech Support\" blog. The name is Jacob Hurwitz, and as for the picture, I have a primo one of him taking a shit. Or a shower. Perhaps a shave. [to Jake] Hm?<br /><br />END",

Amir silently holds up a scroll.]<br /><br />JAKE: No. No, please--<br /><br />AMIR: \"Top Ten Vacation Ideas for the Summer\", by Amir Judy Blume-enfeld.<br /><br />JAKE: Tell you what-- [to others in the office] does anybody want a computer? Does anyone want a desktop? Amir doesn't use his.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number ten--\"<br /><br />JAKE: To work.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Are you feeling zen? If not, a staycation is what I recommend. Or better yet, don't be a jerk. Unwind by being a man... and goin' to work.\"<br /><br />JAKE: So your first vacation idea is not taking one. And working. Which you're not doing right now because you're sitting here, reading me this list.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number nine: Stop whining about the time. Go to work. Can you?\"<br /><br />JAKE: Can you?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Please?\"<br /><br />JAKE: These aren't even vacation ideas!<br /><br />AMIR: It's just the first two!<br /><br />JAKE: Still! They're in the top ten! They're on the list, that you called \"Vacation Ideas\"!<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number eight: You're overweight! 'Cuz you overate. Whip your butt into shape with exercise classes. That's right: a boot camp retreat, for all y'all fatasses!\"<br /><br />JAKE: What is relaxing about a boot camp? How is that a vacation?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number seven: A Sawa named Devon! This tween idol deserves that title. Shack up with 'Now and Then' co-star Devon Sawa in his Hollywood Hills bungalow! Now that sounds like a place that's... fun to go!\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...Isn't Devon Sawa dead?<br /><br />AMIR: You're thinking of Brad Renfro.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Fine.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number six: Check out Brad Renfro's dicks!\"<br /><br />[Jake grimaces in disbelief.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"It's been too long since you've gone to see him. Won't you visit his mausoleum?\"<br /><br />JAKE: That's impolite. Wouldn't you say that's in poor taste? Can't he rest in peace?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number five: an Owen named Clive! He's got a palace in the English hills, and you can visit and stay for the thrills! Clive Owen would love to have ya.\"<br /><br />JAKE: No he wouldn't! So far, three of your ideas have been about visiting celebrities who definitely don't want you there. One of whom is dead.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number four: Lock your door! This staycation is for you and a PlayStation 2. Lock yourself in your room all summer and close the blinds. That's the best way I know how to unwinds! And if it's a weekday... go to work!\"<br /><br />JAKE: You know, that's almost as sad as the Brad Renfro one. How are these vacation ideas? Barely any of them have involved a destination! Most of them have involved not traveling!<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three: How 'bout some tea? It's a good liquid that's nice for your soul. Have it in a cup, a mug, or a... bowl...\" What?<br /><br />JAKE: You crossed lists? With another scroll?<br /><br />AMIR: Shit. Yeah, I think I musta got... [sighs] I-- I need to get my shit together!

Can I change the channel, or do we have to watch this soccer shit?<br /><br />[Jake pushes Amir's hand off of him.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Hi, twat.

Yeah, I love those frickin' things.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you not order in weird rhymes?

My cousin just sent me a text that made me smile. It wasn't you.<br /><br />AMIR: [still laughing] Count it!<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] My credit card number is, um, uh...

They don't affect anyone or anything.<br /><br />PAT: No-- what are your hobbies?<br /><br />AMIR: Well, not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, I'll always pretend like it's buzzing. Make my dumbass mom or my goofy dad walk up to the waitress, time after time, in vain. [chuckles] Then at the end of the bit, I'll throw the beeper away so that my dad ends up owing cash for it.<br /><br />JAKE: Your hobbies are bad.<br /><br />AMIR: No shit, dude.<br /><br />JAKE: You're bad.<br /><br />AMIR: All I'm saying is that real athletes don't wear cleats.

Because the way it works is that you're a Leo, so the stars look like a lion, and it knows what you're gonna-- how you're gonna act.<br /><br />JAKE: Try not to learn new things. [imitating Amir, holding out his hand] The stars look like a lion, and it knows how I'm gonna act?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. They really do. They look like a lion.<br /><br />JAKE: Put your hand down, 'cause you're not teaching me anything, okay? It's like you read the Wikipedia for horoscopes-- I don't even think you got into astrology...<br /><br />[Amir shakes his head.]<br /><br />JAKE: No? I didn't-- didn't think so.<br /><br />AMIR: No way.<br /><br />JAKE: And then you just regurgitate everything like it's your new worldview! Your mind is so impressionable.<br /><br />AMIR: My mind is not impressionable!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it is!<br /><br />AMIR: I guess it is.<br /><br />JAKE: God, that's fast. Even for you, that was fast. You're, like, hypnotized. Like, you'll believe anything anyone says.<br /><br />AMIR: [calmly] I will believe anything anyone says...<br /><br />[Jake pauses.]<br /><br />JAKE: [equally calmly] You're getting sleepy.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm getting... [closing his eyes] sleepy...<br /><br />JAKE: You're getting very sleepy.<br /><br />AMIR: Very sleepy, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't say I was your master.<br /><br />AMIR: Didn't have to.<br /><br />JAKE: Anything I say is your command. Your mind is open to my suggestion.<br /><br />AMIR: I am your mental slave.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Yes.<br /><br />AMIR: And thus, you are my master.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Just don't repeat it, okay?<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: ...When I snap my fingers, you will wake up.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: And when you wake up, you will...<br /><br />AMIR: Cluck like a chicken. Something silly. Boy, will my face be red.<br /><br />JAKE: You'll throw yourself out the window.<br /><br />AMIR: Jesus.<br /><br />JAKE: That's right. When I snap my fingers, you will awaken and run out the window.<br /><br />AMIR: My fear is that the window will be closed and I'll break my neck on the glass. Then you'll be left to deal with me as a quadriplegic, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Open the window...<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: ...then jump.<br /><br />AMIR: No chicken.<br /><br />JAKE: No chicken. Just jumping. Leaping, out of a four-story window, to your death.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Got it.<br /><br />JAKE: Before you go...<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: ...remember to shoot me a text. Something like... \"Hey, there was nothing you could have done to stop me\", et cetera.<br /><br />AMIR: Mm. A suicide note of sorts. Yup.<br /><br />JAKE: A suicide text of sorts. Indeed. So when I snap my fingers--<br /><br />AMIR: Absolving you of guilt.<br /><br />JAKE: Exactly.<br /><br />AMIR: Got it.<br /><br />JAKE: Got it. Okay, so I'm gonna snap my fingers. Wake up, suicide text...<br /><br />AMIR: Chicken.<br /><br />JAKE: Out the window. No chicken.<br /><br />AMIR: No chicken.<br /><br />JAKE: No clucking-- you can do whatever you want on the way down.<br /><br />AMIR: Sure.<br /><br />JAKE: Just be sure to do the... you know, the important bullet points.<br /><br />AMIR: Absolutely. Thank you, Master.<br /><br />[Jake snaps.]<br /><br />AMIR: [waking up] Aaah. Jesus. [laughing in confusion] What happened?<br /><br />JAKE: I don't know, man. Just... whatever. Just chilling.<br /><br />AMIR: [confused, texting Jake] ...I'm texting you....<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, yeah. Go for it.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: [reading, frustrated] Semicolon, dollar sign, \"Jake tried to kill me\", sunglasses emoji, \"I'm not a chicken\".<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up the newspaper] That's right! My horoscope told me to be on the lookout for hypno-killers, and it was right! Sagittarius, motherfucker!<br /><br />JAKE: You're a Capricorn.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] You still tried to kill me! Little fucker!<br /><br />END ",

Your breath smells awful!<br /><br />AMIR: Chill!<br /><br />[Jake and Amir at their desks. Amir is trying to offer Jake a piece of gum while Jake ignores him. Amir waves, getting Jake's attention, and again offers him the gum.]<br /><br />AMIR: Gum?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm OK.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna...have a slice [laughs nervously]...thought I'd offer you one.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm good.<br /><br />AMIR: First you're OK now you're good? [Puts stick of gum half in his mouth so that it's sticking out.] What's wrong with you? You're acting all goofy--[Laughs] I mean are you high at work? I'm not gonna tell anyone, I'm just down to toke! Or at least have a bite of whatever edible you're high!<br /><br />JAKE: I just don't want--<br /><br />AMIR: My gum.<br /><br />JAKE:--to talk to you.<br /><br />AMIR: I know. [Puts up hands in mock defence.]<br /><br />JAKE: [Mimicking Amir] I know?<br /><br />AMIR: I come in peace. [Scoffs.]<br /><br />[Silence]<br /><br />AMIR: [Playing with the piece of gum he hasn't put in his mouth. Squints.] Hmm?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say anything. Do you wish I did? <br /><br />AMIR: Are you sure? It's on the house!<br /><br />JAKE: Did you think I was declining because I thought you were gonna make me pay for it?<br /><br />AMIR: The pack was like two bucks! If you wanna toss me a dollar...sure that'd be fine [Chuckles]. That'd be fair--<br /><br />JAKE: Fair? No it wouldn't. That would mean I get half the pack of gum, and I said no to a piece. <br /><br />AMIR: You said you were OK!? You said you were good--[getting angry] you didn't say jack shit about no. Holy shit; you are high!!<br /><br />JAKE: Relax! Alright? I'll have a piece of gum. <br /><br />AMIR: [Nodding his head] Slice. <br /><br />JAKE: Piece! Never correct me--Just give me the gum!<br /><br />AMIR: [Smugly] Oh. Well. What are you gonna do for me? [Takes out stick of gum. Raises eyebrows suggestively.]<br /><br />JAKE: Never mind.<br /><br />AMIR: Wait! I have something that you want [Holds up piece of gum.]! You gotta pay me back somehow, that's how society works! [Pretends to type on computer] I'm not working here for free! [Chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: You're not working here at all! [Amir is bobbing up and down on his chair and chewing the gum with his mouth open while Jake is talking.] I don't think I've ever seen you do or complete a single task--chew the gum with your mouth closed. Alright? [Amir's movements become more frantic.] You look so unnatural doing it. <br /><br />AMIR: [Still chewing with his mouth open.] It's cool. It's friendly. It's chill--<br /><br />JAKE: Don't bob your head--it's not friendly. What's friendly about it?<br /><br />AMIR: It's like [Amir winks awkwardly. Jake grimaces.]...It's just a nice thing to do! [Laughs weakly.]<br /><br />JAKE: I don't want the gum. I was just gonna take it so you would shut up!<br /><br />AMIR: Shut up! [Amir grimaces.] Really!? [Jake facepalms.] That language?! [Waves pack of gum in the air.] From someone who has something that you want. It's tit for tat, Jakey! When that tit-tat is a Tic Tac or a Kit-Kat, you can't go this that, hit hat! You gotta go mit ma--<br /><br />JAKE: Focus! <br /><br />[Amir doesn't respond or move as he chews his gum loudly, staring at Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: I don't wanna sit next to you anymore. <br /><br />AMIR: [Stops chewing.] What?<br /><br />JAKE: I wanna move desks. <br /><br />[Amir swallows the gum.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake--<br /><br />JAKE: I'm done.<br /><br />AMIR: Gum's gone, man...alright? This is...<br /><br />JAKE: [Shrugging] Doesn't matter that the gum's gone. I'm--<br /><br />AMIR: [Shaking his head, smiling.] It's such a--This is such a small thing in the grand scheme of things. I-i-it's infinitesimal! <br /><br />JAKE: It's small, maybe, in the grand scheme of things but the grand scheme of things is what I'm worried about, OK? It's a lot of little things, like this, adding up. Also...you know, you stabbed me once--<br /><br />AMIR: Once.<br /><br />JAKE: More often than I've stabbed anyone!<br /><br />AMIR: Really?...Shit. I'm sorry!<br /><br />JAKE: That's also the first time you apologized for it which is pretty fucked.<br /><br />AMIR: Just [sighs] look under your desk. <br /><br />[Jake reaches under his desk and pulls out a pack of gum showing it to Amir and smiling slightly.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's my own pack of gum. [Taps pack of gum on desk.]<br /><br />[Amir nods and smiles knowingly.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's a pretty nice gesture. I see where you were going this whole time--<br /><br />AMIR: Now in terms of paying me back are you thinking about cash or favours?<br /><br />JAKE: I thought this was a gift.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I still wanna hang out!!<br /><br />END",

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir, and I do declare!<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know!<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are working at their desks. Amir has fashioned a standing desk for himself by putting a small table on top of his regular desk. He also has a chocolate milkshake and a plate of nachos. He looks down at Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing awkwardly] Unhealthy... [pause] ...What?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say anything. You said \"unhealthy\"--<br /><br />AMIR: Unhealthy much!<br /><br />JAKE: You said \"unhealthy\", then I didn't say anything. If you're trying to start a conversation--<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling over Jake] Look at you--<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you do that? <br /><br />AMIR: [pointing at Jake for emphasis] Bad for your back, bad for your spine, bad for your life, bad for your attitude, bad--<br /><br />JAKE: You're eating nachos!<br /><br />[Amir eats another nacho.]<br /><br />JAKE: You're eating nachos right now, and you're drinking a chocolate milkshake.<br /><br />AMIR: [grabbing the milkshake] Yeah, that's 'cause I have a standing desk! Which means I can afford it... [goes to take a sip, then pauses] ...fuckwad! [takes a sip]<br /><br />JAKE: You're a fuckwad. [Amir wiggles his eyebrows] You think standing at your desk burns-- what, that's like fifteen hundred calories! Alright? And-- ...also, you're sitting.<br /><br />AMIR: [now sitting, bouncing up and down] Yeah, but on an exercise ball! Okay? AKA!<br /><br />[Amir begins making rhythmic hand motions. Jake waits for a while for him to keep talking.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...What?<br /><br />JAKE: ...AKA what?<br /><br />AMIR: What are you, waiting for me to talk? [laughs] Alright! Let's talk!<br /><br />JAKE: Waiting for you to finish! AKA means \"also known as\".<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, I didn't know that... wow!<br /><br />JAKE: It's not just a pe-- it's not the end of the sentence!<br /><br />AMIR: I didn't know that! I thought it was like a pu-- yeah, like a...<br /><br />JAKE: A pun?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a play on words!<br /><br />JAKE: We don't have to talk! We don't have to talk at the office. That's not leading a healthy lifestyle. You can't afford to eat that food.<br /><br />AMIR: My legs were tired, fatass! And by the way, this is healthy! Healthier than the standing desk, 'cause I can do crunches while I work! [closes his eyes and begins doing crunches badly]<br /><br />JAKE: Your eyes are shut. So you're not doing anything while you work. You're just doing crunches, and... what terrible form! You're twirling your ass on top of the ball like you're wiping with it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well they hurt my back pain!<br /><br />JAKE: Redundant.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! I have sciatica, motherfucker!<br /><br />JAKE: I think sciatica is pain in your leg.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes! Which is why I can't stand. So I sit, which hurts my back. That's why I got the desk! It just hurts, so I'm sitting, AKA!<br /><br />JAKE: ...If you're this sick, if you're this unhealthy, why don't you just do the decent thing, and allow yourself to die?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Jesus!<br /><br />JAKE: That was real.<br /><br />AMIR: That's, like, a lot of times you ask me to die.<br /><br />JAKE: I know, and I mean it every time.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing uncomfortably] It's so... sad.<br /><br />JAKE: Trust me, I know.<br /><br />AMIR: It's sad to me that you want me dead.<br /><br />JAKE: I feel bad as a person that I want so badly for you to be dead and gone, but I--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. You're not even hiding it anymore.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I think I'm just gonna be open with it.<br /><br />AMIR: I need to... I need to lay down.<br /><br />[Amir lays down on the floor.]<br /><br />JAKE: Thirty seconds ago, you were boasting about your standing desk, and now you're on the floor.<br /><br />AMIR: [still eating his nachos] It doesn't matter if I'm sitting or lying, okay? As long as my work gets handed in.<br /><br />JAKE: What work are you handing in? You're just shoveling nachos into your face, lying down on the ground, and-- oh my God, you're asleep.<br /><br />[Amir has fallen asleep on the floor.]<br /><br />JAKE: How is that possible? You were just yelling. Now you're asleep.<br /><br />[Amir begins choking on his mouthful of nachos. Jake runs over to help him, and then reconsiders. He watches Amir struggle for air in his sleep, until Amir eventually lies still on the ground.]<br /><br />JAKE: [looking upward, and whispering] Thank you...<br /><br />[Amir suddenly coughs up his nachos all over Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm alive!<br /><br />JAKE: Ass.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing in relief] And it's all thanks to that standing desk.<br /><br />[Jake scowls at Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />END",

Let me do you one better. You know how you have a weird love affair with coupons?<br /><br />JAKE: I know how you make up realities to justify the weird stupid things you do...<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up a coupon book] Here's a book of three hundred and sixty-five coupons.

Non-returnable! Read the fine print! I couldn't take--<br /><br />[Jake throws the coupon book and hits Amir lightly in the forehead.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh!<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry, bud!

Because my credit score is...<br /><br />JAKE: So low.<br /><br />AMIR: ...out of this world!<br /><br />JAKE: Bad.<br /><br />[Amir coos like a pigeon. Jake cringes at his breath.]<br /><br />JAKE: Really bad.<br /><br />AMIR: You know, human caskets, not too terrible of an idea.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't say it.<br /><br />AMIR: If you just wiggle that dorsal fin back and forth like you're peeling off a soda tab, you know, [as he mimes trying to tear off a dorsal fin] A, B, C... and then whatever letter it lands on, that girl has a crush on you?<br /><br />JAKE: What do you mean, \"lands on\"?<br /><br />AMIR: [miming ripping off the fin, making Jake wince] Like if it gets ripped off on S, you're gonna marry a Samantha...!<br /><br />JAKE: You're a monster.<br /><br />AMIR: Now I understand to build my credit score, I need to make my payments in a timely fashion.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, so--<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, and if I don't will they hack my nuts off?<br /><br />[Jake doesn't respond.]<br /><br />AMIR: Then I'm good.<br /><br />JAKE: They're not gonna hack your nuts off--<br /><br />AMIR: Then I'm good.<br /><br />JAKE: --but you'll go into debt and they'll take away your possessions--<br /><br />AMIR: But my nuts? Are they gonna take away my most prized possession? My family jewels? ...I'm okay then.<br /><br />AMIR: Mirror, mirror, on the wa-- [hits a key] \"Denied\". How is that normal?<br /><br />JAKE: It's very normal. It's very normal because under \"Debt\" you wrote \"150K dolphin fee\", under \"Address\" you wrote \"Fuck off NSA\", and under \"Annual Income\"-- I don't even know how you did this, 'cause it's a drop-down menu-- but you wrote \"Flappy the dolphin is my guarantor; give me the gold card\".<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] I wanted the points! I wanted the points, I needed the miles, and I could have really used a trip. [closes his laptop] Least I got my nuts.<br /><br />[Amir looks down.

Amir does not have a computer. He tugs at his hoodie and wiggles his eyebrows at Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: No computer at all today, huh?<br /><br />[Amir shakes his head.]<br /><br />JAKE: Why even come in?<br /><br />AMIR: I can work from my phone. [feels for a phone in his pocket, to no avail] ...Shit.<br /><br />JAKE: Nice.<br /><br />[A woman comes over briefly to hand Amir a manila envelope. Amir notices and begins laughing giddily.]<br /><br />AMIR: [opening the envelope] They're here, they're here!

[laughing] You should have let me finish! Now you look like a fool!<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you need headshots? You have a job. You have a salary. Health insurance.<br /><br />AMIR: I want to be a famous! Ass! A star is born? Nah... a star is corn!<br /><br />[Amir holds up a picture of himself dressed as an ear of corn with big cartoon gloves.]<br /><br />JAKE: What a dumb headshot, buddy.<br /><br />AMIR: Please don't call these dumb. Okay? I spent, like, a bad amount of money on these.<br /><br />JAKE: Any amount of money you spent on those would be a bad amount of money, considering you're not an actor and you don't need them.<br /><br />AMIR: I have an audition today!<br /><br />[Jake raises his eyebrows. Amir grins silently at him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Wow! Suddenly, Jake's-- actually, this is perfect! [handing a fork and a knife to Jake] I'll give you a fork and a knife so you can eat your words. And, in addition to those--<br /><br />JAKE: [taking the fork and knife] God, these are nice.<br /><br />AMIR: --I have a napkin... where the French is it? I don't want you to spill the words--<br /><br />JAKE: Did you bring this cutlery to work just to make me do this?<br /><br />AMIR: Where the fff-- is it, dude?<br /><br />JAKE: [putting down the fork and knife] It doesn't matter where the napkin is, okay? What's the role?<br /><br />AMIR: The role is of a paralegal, in the film \"Steinberg and Ginsberg\".<br /><br />JAKE: Are you sure you don't mean firm Steinberg and Ginsberg? And the role is just an office job that you're not qualified for?<br /><br />AMIR: Every interview in this town is an audition. In this town.<br /><br />JAKE: Nice, dude. Give it to me.<br /><br />[Amir hands Jake the headshots. On top is one of Amir shirtless, wearing jeans low enough on his hips that his pubic hair is visible, albeit censored.]<br /><br />JAKE: Yikes. Way too revealing. Right? I mean, at least you had the decency to blur your pubes.<br /><br />AMIR: [sadly] No, they're just blurry.<br /><br />JAKE: You grow blurry pubic hair?<br /><br />AMIR: I think so, yeah. They're mosaic.<br /><br />JAKE: [holding up a picture of Amir with Terry Richardson] Sorry, did Terry Richardson take these?<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, they were taken by a Brazilian photographer. [grabbing the headshots back] Nunya? Ever heard of him?<br /><br />JAKE: Nunya Business?<br /><br />AMIR: No, Nunya Luiz Ricardio. He's actually pretty famous in Rio.<br /><br />JAKE: Do something else with your life.<br /><br />[Amir is suddenly holding a colorful and simplistic painting with two stick figures.]<br /><br />AMIR: Been painting recently! Nothing too crazy, just some abstract pieces. Trying to open up my own gallery.<br /><br />JAKE: That's crazy! Of course that's crazy. Trying to open up your own gallery when you have a job, and... you're not very good at painting!<br /><br />AMIR: Subjective.<br /><br />JAKE: You're so fast at being dumb. Why don't you just try to harness that power for good, instead of... stupidity?<br /><br />AMIR: [holding a plate of burnt cookies] Been baking recently!<br /><br />JAKE: Quick. Burned.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, nothing too crazy. Just, uh, applying for grants to open up my own patisserie/gallery.<br /><br />JAKE: Bad business idea. Bad you. Just stop acting, stop painting, stop baking. It's a waste of time, money, and I think effort, though it seems like you don't try very hard at anything.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up a napkin folded into an origami swan] Found your napkin!<br /><br />JAKE: That one's pretty good.<br /><br />AMIR: Nothing too crazy, just some, uh... oregano.<br /><br />JAKE: Origami.<br /><br />AMIR: Roach!<br /><br />JAKE: It's a swan.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass!<br /><br />END",

So here I--<br /><br />AMIR: [leaning in from off-screen] I did it a few weeks ago!<br /><br />JAKE: Did I invite you in here to brag, Blumenfeld? I don't like to share the limelight, so why don't you tread light.

Just relax about why I invited you in here. [to the camera] Look, been seein' this Cup of Water Challenge thing on Facebook, but... you know, I'mma do it J-Witz style, do you two better. First of all: I say fuck it, I'm gonna go a whole bucket. And, uh, another thing, Regis: I put a freakin' ice cube in here.

I'm not gonna do this before challenging a couple of my close personal friends to, uh, take the Jake challenge, that is, not a cup, but the fuck-it bucket, and, uh, not just one, but a big-ass cube o' ice! [laughs]<br /><br />AMIR: S-- ...so yes. Just one.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. Bradley Cooper, from Limitless. Tarvis Baker, from Blink-182 [pronounced \"eighteen-two\"]. And, and another guy: Vanilla Bean Ice himself! Stop-- Hammer time! [humming] Dahh-nah-nah-nah... nah-nah, can't touch this.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright. Here we go. Ready.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, hey, hold on, before you do it, [to the camera] as I understand it, I was challenged to donate a hundred dollars to ALS research, unless I dump this, this bucket of water on my head, in which case...

Oh-ho-ho-ho, that was legit! Less than room temp, dude! Look! Major shrinkage.<br /><br />[Jake shows Amir his penis below-screen, and Amir, who was initially hopping up and down with adrenaline, stops.]<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa.

Bad teeth!<br /><br />AMIR: Hope you like to barbecue!<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />AMIR: 'Cause homeboy's got a grill!<br /><br />JAKE: Why did you do that to your face? What's wrong with you?<br /><br />AMIR: I like flaunting that I make cash!<br /><br />JAKE: How do you make cash?<br /><br />AMIR: [rubbing his fingers together] Money--<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't ask what cash was. I asked how you made it. You don't do anything.<br /><br />AMIR: My dad gives me bank. Quite bank, actually.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, then you know what? You don't make anything. You get pathetic handouts from your old man, and it's not cool to flaunt that with exorbitantly expensive jewelry for your teeth.<br /><br />AMIR: I got this grill off Sale!<br /><br />JAKE: On sale, and still, it's probably pretty expensive.<br /><br />AMIR: No, my cousin Leron. He has a friend named Sale.<br /><br />JAKE: He's got a friend named Sale?<br /><br />AMIR: Well, had a friend named Sal.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Sale, or Sal?<br /><br />AMIR: Sale.

Sale, Sal, or Sam?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Sale.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't matter. Okay, you got the grill off him?<br /><br />AMIR: Off her. And no, not her grill, her teeth. Okay? When she passed, me and Leron had the dim idea  to gank the dentures off her still-breathing body!<br /><br />JAKE: Still breathing. So she hadn't passed.<br /><br />AMIR: We're all at the vet trying to huff some of that laughy gassy, when we realized: uh-oh! Some of it's euthanasia! So me and Leron hightail it the fuck out of there, but, uh... Sale wasn't too lucky. She couldn't flap her wings fast enough.<br /><br />JAKE: Flap her wings?<br /><br />AMIR: Did I mention Sale was a goose?<br /><br />JAKE: ...No! No, of course not, 'cause then all my questions would have been about that! Why did the goose have teeth?<br /><br />AMIR: I guess you can say she's trans-gandered!<br /><br />JAKE: Decent pun, doesn't explain the teeth, and your gums are bleeding.<br /><br />AMIR: [with his hand on his mouth] Sure, small price to pay.<br /><br />JAKE: Kind of a lot of blood, and it's a pretty big price to pay, man! You don't have teeth. You and your cousin are friends with a goose.<br /><br />AMIR: Were!<br /><br />JAKE: Still! A goose!<br /><br />AMIR: No, I mean me and Leron aren't cousins anymore! He frickin' divorced me!<br /><br />JAKE: Please, just one insane thing at a time. Why did the goose have teeth?<br /><br />AMIR; Dentures.<br /><br />JAKE: Which you stole.<br /><br />AMIR: How was your weekend? ...Always talkin' about my shit. How was your Friday? What'd you do Saturday morning?<br /><br />JAKE: Where are your real teeth?<br /><br />AMIR: I traded them to Leron for a BeDazzler so that I can jewel-encrust Sale's dentures so that I can flaunt my father's wealth! What don't you get?<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you hate yourself?<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE You're on this twisted quest to change your body, mind, and spirit. You're constantly adopting new hobbies. [Amir begins dancing in his seat.] You've had countless plastic surgeries-- stop dancing! [Amir stops.] None of it is ever to any avail. At the end of the day, you're still you... and you suck.<br /><br />[Amir makes a mock-hurt expression.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, I know that did hurt.<br /><br />[Amir dabs his forehead, and salutes Jake sarcastically. Jake salutes him back. Amir pauses, and then begins crying.]<br /><br />JAKE: There it is. [claps] Finally. That's what I was hoping for. That's the way you should always be.<br /><br />AMIR: Want to know the gayest part?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't use that word like that.<br /><br />AMIR: I truly believe that the world revolves around me.

[picks up a marble and a tennis ball, and rolls the tennis ball around the marble]<br /><br />JAKE: Quick to get those.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, this is how I feel. Like I am at the center of it. Like I'm the Sun. [chuckles] I mean, how dumb is that?<br /><br />JAKE: It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Nothing revolves around you. You absolutely don't matter, 'cause you're a goose murderer. You're a teeth thief.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well at least I got a grill I can count on! [holds up a sausage] Hope you like sausage!<br /><br />JAKE: Raw meat. In your mouth.<br /><br />[Amir puts the sausage to its mouth, and it begins smoking and sizzling.]<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit, how is it sizzling?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm the Sun!

That's the most boring idea in the world. You'll just have a package with the name Vance on it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, but then after a while, the mailman will start to call you Vance! He'll be like, \"Hey Vance, how's it going?\" You'll be like, \"Oh, it's pretty good, but actually boom! Gotcha!

Yeah, I know.<br /><br />AMIR: A gala. Yeah, exactly right, a gala.<br /><br />JAKE: Tell you what, buddy. Why don't you just leave them in your online basket, you don't have to check out right now--<br /><br />AMIR: No way.<br /><br />JAKE: --but if you get invited to a white tie event--<br /><br />AMIR: No, dude!

It's burned bad.<br /><br />JAKE: It's cut!<br /><br />AMIR: Absolutely! Sliced from taint to sphincter! Gutted like a fish!<br /><br />JAKE: So climb up on out of that copier, huh? Pal? Can't be worth it.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Is it funny?<br /><br />JAKE: Is what funny?<br /><br />AMIR: The copies. Am I the office clown as of yet, do you think?<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing's funny about this! It's self-mutilation, bud! And there are no copies.<br /><br />AMIR: Where's the paper?<br /><br />JAKE: You pressed \"fax\"! You're faxing a picture of your burned, bleeding asshole to my accountant.<br /><br />AMIR: Then have him scan and email it back!<br /><br />JAKE: It's a her, and no.<br /><br />AMIR: [chuckling] Chicks can't do math, dude.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't be misogynistic. You're getting fucked by a copier.<br /><br />AMIR: It's a five-in-one workstation! And fine, I'll-- I'll copy it. Here we go. Ready?<br /><br />[Amir presses some buttons, but the copying doesn't begin.]<br /><br />AMIR: What the butt is that? \"PC Load Letter\"?<br /><br />JAKE: The drawer is empty.<br /><br />AMIR: Will you insert paper to Tray 2?<br /><br />JAKE: You should have looked before you--<br /><br />AMIR: Will you insert paper to Tray 2?<br /><br />JAKE: No! I will not! I will not do that. I'm not gonna help you.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. I'll do it without you.<br /><br />[Amir begins bending forward slowly, moaning in pain.]<br /><br />JAKE: I'll do it. God, just stop.<br /><br />AMIR: This-- this may kill me, sure, but, like with any tortured artist, my work will live beyond me.<br /><br />[Jake kneels down, surrounded by shards of bloodied glass, and loads the paper tray.]<br /><br />AMIR: I shall be remembered as a martyr, a cool, and a philosopher. For I have the anus of a god.<br /><br />[Amir has posted a copy on the bulletin board. He watches it intently to see if anybody will react. Pat walks by, looks at it, smirks, and continues on his way.]<br /><br />AMIR: Perfect.<br /><br />JAKE: Nobody even knows you did that. And you have to wear a diaper now.<br /><br />[Amir, wearing a diaper, puts his leg up on the desk to strike a pose. There is a loud ripping sound.]<br /><br />AMIR: Worth it, baby!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh God, you need new stitches.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />END",

Amir comes in with flowers.]<br /><br />AMIR: [first singing to the tune of \"Here Comes the Bride\", then just yelling] Here comes the dweeb... Here comes the dweeb! [speaking to Jake] Shittiest Weekend of the Ever Award goes to, dumroll please... Amir Hurwitz! \"You like me! You really like me!\" Friday night, I crash a feminist meeting, and told each and every one of them the God's honest truth: that they were all on the rag! Their aunt Flo didn't just come into town to visit. She moved in, and they were becoming scissor sisters. I wish one thing led to another, because what happened next was all at once. They tied my wrists to my face, shoved a tampon in my asshole, and kicked me out into the street! Keep in mind, this was 7:45 PM, so it's still bright out and I'm missing Jeopardy! I will take \"Things You Don't Want Your Parents to See after Leaving a Restaurant for Their Forty-Second Anniversary\" for, let's say, two hundred, Alex. [humming the Jeopardy theme] Doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo doo doo doo doo, ba-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo, doo-doo doo doo-- [raspberry] --doo-- [raspberry] --doo. Bom, bom. What is their thirty-one-year-old son scooting across the sidewalk like a baby in a diaper, trying to grind the tampon out of his bleeding asshole while he howls at the moon like a wolf! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! And what did you wager, Alex? Zero dollars? That's... that's funny, 'cause that's how much my life was worth to the police officer who, rather than unbind me, took out his Motorola Krzr and added me to his SnapStory. What? Just as I start to think outside the bun, you know, convincing myself that at the very least this will be a fun little anecdote to tell at my bachelor party-- if I don't decide to go stag to my own wedding-- four of these femmes fatales emerge from the shadows, [pointing to his body] and start assaulting my face, [pointing to his neck] my body, [pointing to his face] and my neck. All of them had hair of gold, [singing the \"Brady Bunch\" theme] like their mother... the youngest one threw squirrels! One landed in my mouth, like a furry ball gag. Finally, out of fear, loathing, or Las Vegas, I j-- [chuckles] I just start spray-shitting everywhere. Yeah, it's like someone's dumping bucket after bucket of chocolate pudding on a rotating helicopter blade. I am defecating hither and thither, still howling, still at the moon, this time blue corn. With the tampon finally out, hands still tied to my face, [Ace Ventura impression] I finally have the wherewithalrighty then! to let out on more zinger. One more joke, this one luckily not at their expense. It's-- it's pretty broad, actually. [taking off his glasses] It goes a little something like this: A woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, \"Hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen.\" The woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, \"That bus driver just insulted me.\" I said, \"Lady, you don't have to take that from him. You go up there and tell him off. Here, I'll hold your monkey.\"<br /><br />[Jake chuckles.]<br /><br />AMIR: Seeing you chuckle at that joke made the entire weekend worthwhile.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh-- no. Paul's cousin texted me something funny.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well my asshole needs stitches! So start laughin', buster!<br /><br />END",

There's legit frickin' government agendas reading your sex and getting off to every adjective! \"What are you wearing?\" I'll tell you what it is! It's the new Apple iCloak! [slowly getting more high-pitched] But it's not invisibility, it's actually visibility! AKA, the visible ability... for Apple Geniuses... to get off! Jerk off! Nut to you!

You're holding it right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Mine's jailbroken, you fucking idiot! It's running Linux, Java!<br /><br />JAKE: Is your social security card taped to the back of it?<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! You know why? So that I don't lose it, dipshit!<br /><br />JAKE: You're a dipshit. I never even said I wanted the new iPhone.<br /><br />AMIR: Good.

Amir is playing a guitar.]<br /><br />AMIR: So when I take my hand and go with you, be sure to leave me high, to do... goodbye, my love, goodbye, my-- prrd. To each her own, to each her... I love you...! [stops singing] ...Stupid.<br /><br />JAKE: So stupid.<br /><br />AMIR: It's crazy.<br /><br />JAKE: That you did that at work?<br /><br />AMIR: [balancing the guitar on the desk] Guitar's like... part of my body at this point.<br /><br />[Amir lets go of the guitar, and it falls hard to the floor. Jake cringes.]<br /><br />JAKE: Did that hurt?<br /><br />AMIR: That's actually a polished final. On vinyl, actually, but if you have a note or a feedback, I'd love to hear it.<br /><br />JAKE: If I had a single feedback? Not to write music. Don't write music.<br /><br />AMIR: Joke's on you, 'cause music's not about a single note. It's about a harmony. [laughs] Not surprised you didn't know that, though, 'cause you don't know shit about folk, or folk about shit!<br /><br />JAKE: You have a job here. I don't know why, but you do, so why don't you focus on being good at that. For instance, you didn't even bring a computer charger today. I guess you just figured two hours of work and then you'd be done. And if you don't want to get good at your job, which is... I guess bad, but, fine-- focus on things that would make you a better human being, like hygiene. Brush your teeth. Wipe your ass.<br /><br />AMIR: That's funny, I don't remember that part of the song! How about giving me notes about melody, about tune, about how it sounded?<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. So you're not listening to me.<br /><br />AMIR: I am. I'll do that. I'll do the stuff about the brushing.<br /><br />JAKE: Do what?<br /><br />AMIR: Brush my hair!<br /><br />JAKE: What's something that you don't brush? Not your hair. What's something else that you don't brush?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't brush my hair, ya fuckin' idiot!

I knew as soon as I went off and did something cute and subjective, you would turn it into this, this, this, this, this, this nuclear bomb of me!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? Talk normal. Okay? \"Nuclear bomb of me\"? \"Smile of you\"? You're digressing! You used to be able to speak English.<br /><br />[Amir is raising his arms defensively.]<br /><br />JAKE: Put your arms down! What are you doing?<br /><br />AMIR: Your attitude almost makes me not want to write a song and perform it for you at work... yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Good. That... that is the first time I've ever seen you come close to making a right decision.<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse...?<br /><br />JAKE: That inkling that you have--<br /><br />AMIR: You're a dickling!<br /><br />JAKE: I said \"inkling\", but you are the dickling. Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: You're a dickling!<br /><br />JAKE: The inkling that you have, to not do something because you know I'll think it's dumb? That's the first step into, I guess, adolescence. You finally have the social intelligence of an eleven-year-old.<br /><br />AMIR: Well if you like that song, then you truly are the apple of my pie.<br /><br />[Amir pulls out an apple pie, and pies himself in the face with it. It slides off gradually, and Amir looks disappointed in himself.]<br /><br />AMIR: [to himself] Why'd you do that, ya idiot? ...You turn every positive into a weird thing of you.

I wonder how that got in there-- oh, maybe it was from a one-night stand I had with a 10!<br /><br />JAKE: [grabbing the underwear] You know what? This is embarrassing, 'cause I saw you open a new package of women's underwear, smell them, crumple them up, and put them in the bottom of the bag. You fake-dropped them on the floor in front of me twice, hoping I would notice, then you finally just dangled them in front of my face and said \"how embarrassing\".

Let me give you some more options.<br /><br />JAKE: No, no no no--<br /><br />[Amir is dressed as a doctor in scrubs.]<br /><br />AMIR: Fun thing about this costume: you can wear it after Halloween, and get into hospitals pretty easily.<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you need to get into hospitals?<br /><br />AMIR: For fun little pranks! Like two weeks ago, I walk up to a family of four in a waiting room who's [air quotes] \"awaiting news\", and I'm just covered in fake blood, and I go, \"I'm... so sorry.\" They start bawling, I can't even keep a straight face!

I thought this was for a costume party.<br /><br />AMIR: What's a costume part?<br /><br />[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume, and Jake is continuing the story.]<br /><br />JAKE: The boogeyman's cue card said \"I can see you, you spendthrift, you Jew spendthrift. Now come down here and give me cash or I'll boogie you.\"<br /><br />AMIR: That's correct.<br /><br />JAKE: You also mentioned the other side of his sign said \"Why lie? I need pot\", so I think you might have just gotten swindled by a homeless man.<br /><br />AMIR: Perhaps, maybe. Mayhaps, probably.<br /><br />JAKE: Probably.<br /><br />[Amir is dressed in a German costume with lederhosen. The liquid in his beer stein is a shade of yellow completely unlike beer.]<br /><br />AMIR: [in a German accent] You Americans have Halloween, we call it Oktoberfest. Prost!<br /><br />JAKE: Did you piss in that?<br /><br />AMIR: Ja, ja, I had to make it a bit yellow. [dips his finger in and sniffs it]<br /><br />[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume.

Get ready, I'm gonna boogie you.\" [Amir flinches.] So you ran away to the nearest ATM, and took out even more money.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, the boogeyman's appetite for cash was insatiable, to be sure.

I'm tired of this.<br /><br />JAKE: Me too.<br /><br />AMIR: It's year in, year out, and it wears on you.<br /><br />JAKE: It really does, every day.<br /><br />AMIR: It's fatigue.<br /><br />JAKE: It is.<br /><br />AMIR: That's what it is. I feel... drained.<br /><br />[Amir is in the Leonidas costume, and Jake is reeling from a kick in the chest.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohhh, you can't just go around kicking people in the chest, man! God, that's a dated costume!<br /><br />AMIR: Dated?<br /><br />[Amir stands up again.]<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, stop. Hey.<br /><br />AMIR: [preparing to kick Jake again] This is Sparta!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't, don't--<br /><br />[Amir, in the prisoner costume, continues his lament.]<br /><br />AMIR: Look at me.<br /><br />JAKE: I know. I'm telling you, this is self-reflection right now. It really feels like it's... it feels healthy--<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly energetic again] I'm doing a character! You idiot!

He and his date are sitting in uncomfortable silence. She brushes her hair away from her eyes, and in response, Amir makes a face as if he's straining to hear something she said.]<br /><br />AMIR: [almost inaudibly] Hm?<br /><br />[Amir's date just shakes her head. They sit in silence for a while longer, and then she yawns.]<br /><br />AMIR: And I win! You spoke first, and thus I have the upper hand now.<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: I didn't say anything.<br /><br />AMIR: Power play. [chuckles] What's so funny, maggot?<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: Nothing.<br /><br />AMIR: Look, this isn't my first rodeo, okay? I'm on Tinder, Grindr, GROWLr, OKCupid, SoGayStupid, Twinge, Hinge, JDate, JSwipe, YouPorn, JYouPorn... I've seen it all, honey. What's your poison?<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: \"Twinge\"?<br /><br />AMIR: I have not heard of that one. Is that a digestif?<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: You said Twinge. I don't know what that is.<br /><br />AMIR: [to the server] Let's get my date a wine, and I think I will have... twinge.<br /><br />[The server pours Amir's date a glass of wine. As he stops pouring, Amir tips his hand back the way it was, filling the glass to the very top. Unable to pick it up without spilling it, Amir's date leans in to sip from it.]<br /><br />AMIR: So here's what I'm gonna offer you: [holding up a wad of bills] this is five hundred dollars in cash, and it's yours if you leave right now.<br /><br />[She grabs the cash and begins counting.]<br /><br />AMIR: Just know that if you do take the money and run, that's it. You can't come back. No more second date. Sort of a coy little way to figure out if my dates are in it for the long Paul! [holds up a picture of Paul Dano]<br /><br />[Amir's date leaves with the money.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...No one's ever not taken the cash.<br /><br />[Cut to black.]<br /><br />AMIR: Fuck.<br /><br />[The rest of Amir's night is presented in a melancholy montage. Amir walks home, twitching with frustration. For lack of any emotional outlet, Amir lunges at a homeless man to try and make him flinch. The man lunges back, growling. Amir screams and runs away.]<br /><br />[Amir enters his dark apartment and locks the door. He kicks one shoe off and tosses it into the corner, then flops down on his bed. He kicks off his other shoe, and it nearly hits him in the face. By his bedside table, we see that Amir has several pictures of Jake.]<br /><br />[Amir unbuckles his belt and puts his hand in his pants. He masturbates while staring listlessly at the ceiling of his apartment.]<br /><br />AMIR: [orgasming] Oooo!<br /><br />[Amir opens a packet of barbecue sauce and puts it on some chicken nuggets for himself.]<br /><br />[Amir stares into the mirror, holding a toothbrush with toothpaste on it, and contemplates brushing his teeth. He shakes his head, and puts the toothbrush back down, throwing the toothpaste tube onto the sink counter with it.]<br /><br />[Amir lies in bed, still numb. A framed picture of him and Jake sits in the background on his bedside table. Amir quietly begins crying.]<br /><br />[Amir comes in to the office the next day, and sits down in the chair in solemn silence. Jake stares at him, waiting for something.]<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly as energetic as ever] Got laid last night! [laughs]<br /><br />END",

Adolf Hitler killed himself, Mickey, and history remembers him as a coward, Mickey!<br /><br />JAKE: Excuse you!<br /><br />AMIR: You haven't lost anything until you sell, Mickey, and I, as your broker, am not gonna let you do that, Mickey!

This company's selling for pennies on the dollar, and I could turn these coins into golden doubloons for you and yours, Mickey! You ask your wife for permission, and this deal goes away, Mickey. Okay? You don't think I can walk this deal over to Hamburger? You don't think I can trike it over to Lasagna?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Trike\"?<br /><br />AMIR: It doesn't matter to me which one of my clients makes that cheese, Mickey, 'cause I'm still eatin' crackers like we're puttin' on the Ritz, Mickey!

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: Hello, 'tis the season to watch Jake and Amir! [in a lower register, as Jake] Nice. [singsong] Thank you!<br /><br />[Amir is at his desk, and has Jake on video chat on his computer.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...So...?<br /><br />JAKE: You called me. It's not my job to start a conversation.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, my Thanksgiving? Of course! I'll tell you everything. [chuckles] I was excited to see my loved ones and enjoy a festive meal. Unfortunately, nothing went according to flan! [holds up flan on a plate, laughs at his own joke, and then drops it on his desk] Anyway, listen to this boar shit! I get home Thanksgiving Eve Eve, and I don't know if it's the excitement or the fact that I haven't showered in a couple of... evers, but I develop a zit the size of a gumball on my forehead! I think it's inconvenient, sure, but when I woke up to my dad trying to lance and drain the bitch with a toothbrush he sharpened like a shiv, I'm equal parts appalled and dumb! The vain diva! He said my blemish would ruin everyone's appetite and holiday. So I says to him, I says, straight up, \"Look, I don't have to have dinner with you guys. Frankly, I don't want to have dinner with you guys. But I gotta eat something, or I'm gonna be hangry.\" That's hungry and angry. So he sits silently for a spell, right, and I see something wash over him, this quiet serenity, and I realize this dingbat's gonna lock me in the room! That's the split-second we both charge for the door, and maybe I knock him off course, or maybe he frickin' slipped on the oil dripping from the golf-ball-sized zit, but the roach barrels headlong into the door jamb, and he's out cold. I'm talking frigid, frigid cold. His body is ice, his pulse is... is not. Keep in mind, my old man's forty-two, so at this point, him being dead is no bueno. No bueno at all. So I, I get down on my knees and I pray that the CPR that I saw on an episode of House M.D. on somebody else's TV on an airplane five years ago fucking registered with me! That's right, I'm pumping his chest, leaning in, giving him deep mouth-to-mouth, tongue and all, and having never performed or understood the maneuver, going on just what friggin' Hugh Laurie did on the show, and my daddy's not having any of it. He starts kicking and screaming, and I shout \"Hold still or you're a dead! You're an absolute dead!\" and he-- of course, he takes that the wrong way, I mean look at me! [breaks down into cackling] He reaches down into his pocket, all of a sudden, Papa's [suddenly singing] all about that Mace, 'bout that Mace, no bubble. As in he burst my bubble, when he realized I wasn't the George-Clooney-shaped hero that he hoped I was when he P-sprayed me in the face! The noxious liquid, of absolute course, does nothing to help the zit situation, or zituation for short, and the thing swells up to the size of a tennis ball, throbbing, pulsating, and yes, eventually speaking. Unintelligent squeaks at first, but gaining intelligence by the nanosecond, a full-on sentient staph infection, methinks! My dad gets one look at this horror show, and, and-- and of course he dives out of the window, presumably to his death, but probably not, because my, my room's in the basement. I look in the mirror, and the zit, speaking in tongues at this point, though I understand, demands that I feed it. To a regular human, it's: [makes grotesque noises from his throat] --to me, it's: \"Feed me, feed me, feed me!\" [laughs] So I march downstairs on the pimple's order and begin using the turkey syringe thing, the, uh... the, the, you know, the little ear-bulb thing, the, uh, the... [as if Jake had said something] ...right, the baster. And I'm squeezin' and suckin', feeding and pouring the gravy on the zit, feeding the zit gravy, like it's the opposite of volca-- of a volcano, and it grows, both in size and anger. Finally, the bitch is so big, I'm beginning to think I'm a growth on it, and not the other way around! I mean, at this point, it's borderline comical! So naturally, I throw up my hands and I laugh. Which is right when my dad comes in and sees this-- I mean, I-- how can you describe this as, as anything else but a burlesque show? It really is a burlesque show! And he starts chuckling to himself, and I'll share credit with the evil whitehead, but I got to admit, I'm feeling not bad, because this is the first time, probably ever, that I've seen my dad smile. We go to high five, he misses, probably on purpose, and boom! He hits my zit/boil/Lord and Savior, and boom goes the dynamite. The noise is deafening. And what an explosion! Oh, the humanity! I mean, the entire room is covered in pus and gravy. It looks like... it looks like the inside of an unnatural cave, just stalactites and stalagmites of, of, of, of, of, of this, this, this, this, this, this mucus. This, this pussy, mucusy gravy. So I look-- I look at my old man, this, this forty-two-year-old raisin of a prune at this point, and I go, \"So, uh... who wants pizza?\" [laughing] He starts laughing so hard... he faints, and then my mom is also passing out, because of the, uh... the pus everywhere is steamy hot, so she's sort of suffocating on the moisture, and she faints too, and then just before I pass out, I have this thought, this, this fleeting thought, I'm like, uh... \"How the hell did I turn out so normal?\" [pauses, sighs, then waves his hand at the screen] Y'ello? Can you hear me?<br /><br />[Throughout Amir's entire story, Jake has been ignoring him, occupying himself instead by texting, peeling a sticker off of a thermos, and even leaving to get chips at one point. Until the present moment, Amir has been too immersed in his own story to notice.]<br /><br />JAKE: Yo! Hey, um, sorry. I muted you, in case you told a story that made me sad.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! No wonder you didn't... [holding up the flan] you didn't laugh at the flan joke.<br /><br />JAKE: I heard the flan joke. That was when I muted you. It was a bad joke.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you... you, uh... you liked it. [laughs, pauses] You liked it.<br /><br />END",

[laughs] Later on, Leron and I French kissed in front of a security camera as a goof, and I fear some of the original Ebola-infected feces went from his throat into mine.<br /><br />JAKE: If that's all true, then you deserve to have Ebola.<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse...?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Never say that again.<br /><br />AMIR: How do you figure, is all?<br /><br />JAKE: You're teasing a nurse--<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: --who's coming back from Liberia, she went there to help--<br /><br />AMIR: No, no, no, no, no! Listen to the case, dude! Leron was teasing a nurse--<br /><br />JAKE: Leron teased the nurse.<br /><br />AMIR: Leron teased the nurse.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. You Frenched him.<br /><br />AMIR: I Frenched-- yeah. I French kissed my cousin Leron.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay-- after he had shit in his mouth, and he didn't wash it out!<br /><br />AMIR: As a goof. As a goof, I French kissed--<br /><br />JAKE: As a goof-- it doesn't matter! You're su-- you're-- it's implicit support, is what it is, of his bad actions--<br /><br />AMIR: I'm tongue-kissing him. Okay? I'm tongue-kissing him--<br /><br />JAKE: I caught that part! I--<br /><br />AMIR: --and then I'm afraid that some of the shit in his mouth went into my tongue.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you think I don't understand what happened? I'm saying that those--<br /><br />AMIR: You're saying I teased the nurse. Like I'm a nurse-teaser.<br /><br />JAKE: I got one thing wrong. I got the Frenching right, though.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I--<br /><br />JAKE: Because you French kissed your cousin--<br /><br />AMIR: As a goof--<br /><br />JAKE: --As a goof--<br /><br />JAKE/AMIR: [simultaneously] --on camera.<br /><br />JAKE: Die, then.<br /><br />[Amir vomits.]<br /><br />AMIR: Don't say shit like that, or I'll quarantine your ass!<br /><br />END",

Amir has headphones on. He gasps and grabs his chest, and then turns his attention to Jake and takes off his headphones.]<br /><br />AMIR: I am absolutely obsessed with the new Serial podcast!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, man. I like it a l--<br /><br />[Amir aggressively shushes Jake. As Amir talks, Jake mouths \"Are you kidding me?\"]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm like, every time a new episode comes out, I, I'm just like-- [makes excited eating motions, laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: What are you doing? I was willing to have a conversation with you, and you're steamrolling it. You just have an agenda, and you won't interact with me.<br /><br />AMIR: [talking over Jake] I love it so much! I don't know, I can't explain it! I'm on the edge of my seat. I'm not even halfway done with the second episode, and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I can't get enough! I literally started, like, three weeks ago.<br /><br />JAKE: So you're not obsessed at all! You barely listen to it. You listened to one and a half episodes?<br /><br />AMIR: Less than.<br /><br />JAKE: Less!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Less! What?<br /><br />AMIR: But I'm very active in the subreddit. Yeah, I'm in there theorizing, postulating... actually stirring up a good amount of resentment, and... ill will towards you and me both.<br /><br />JAKE: [looking at his laptop] Okay, yeah. Here's your first post: \"I'm a key witness. I was in the library with Asia McClain. It was me, not Adnan. My name is Jake Hurwitz, ask me anythang.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Does posting in the subreddit make me a lawyer?<br /><br />JAKE: Of course not.<br /><br />AMIR: I mean, not necessarily.<br /><br />JAKE: Not at all.<br /><br />AMIR: But, it might make me a law clerk or, at the very least, a paralegal. I'm definitely, definitely at least a detective for it.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a detective?<br /><br />AMIR: I think so.<br /><br />JAKE: You just posted five minutes ago: \"MFW Sarah Koenig said the F-word,\" and... [clicking] ...it's a link to scat porn.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm a gumshoe. I'm a gumshoe of a detective, a rookie cop with a, with a chip on his shoulder!<br /><br />JAKE: You are so much less important than you think you are.<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE: Stop trying to half-assedly insert yourself into something successful, after the fact. It's lazy.<br /><br />AMIR: Went to visit Adnan yesterday.<br /><br />JAKE: ...No!<br /><br />AMIR: Was ready to offer him a conjugal, but the warden turned me down on Adnan's behalf!<br /><br />JAKE: That makes a lot of sense, man. You offered a conjugal visit to a convicted murderer?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, spoiler much?<br /><br />JAKE: So you know nothing about the podcast. Have you listened to the one and a half episodes?<br /><br />AMIR: Downloaded! [holding up two fingers, one hooked to represent half] I said I've downloaded one and a half episodes!<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't! You said you listened!<br /><br />AMIR: I listened to part of one. I got to the MailChimp part, [pronounced \"MailKimp\", as in the podcast's ad] but I can really see why people are hot on this shit!<br /><br />JAKE: Cool, so you listened to one part of the ad, and you're still very active in the subreddit.<br /><br />AMIR: You don't have to know shit to be angry about shit. You just have to have an opinion, dumbass!<br /><br />JAKE: Your opinion doesn't have to be angry!<br /><br />AMIR: I'll often post without doing very much research at all, just passing off biased viewpoints as fact! Potentially redundant, definitely hurtful, and all caps, all the time, baby! Upvote!<br /><br />JAKE: S-- ...upvote?<br /><br />AMIR: Upvote!<br /><br />JAKE: Upvote what?<br /><br />AMIR: Upvote!<br /><br />JAKE: You want to upvote this? \"My name is Amir Hurwitz-Syed, and I am a member of Adnan's mosque. This is a picture of us playing ball back in the day. Even then, Adnan was a goofy killer, on the court. ;)\" [Jake reads this as \"winky face\", and Amir winks as he reads] \"Ask Me Almost Everything.\" And the picture's just a broken image. You wrote: \"Edit: This link works,\" and then that is a picture of your penis Photoshopped onto Adnan's high school yearbook photo. Small dick, by the way. You commented: \"Edit: Gotcha! But on the real, no lie, this is legit. This is the image. I had to dig through my mom's old photo albums,\" and that link is just...<br /><br />[Jake clicks, and Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" plays from his computer. Amir dances to the music.]<br /><br />JAKE: What's wrong with you?<br /><br />AMIR: And that made it to the front page! Wanna know why?<br /><br />JAKE: Because it didn't.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right! I'm lying, but it doesn't matter, because I'm loud, so you have to acknowledge me! That's the beauty of the internet! Ask me anythong! [pulls out a thong]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh...! Why were you wearing that?<br /><br />AMIR: Conjugal, motherfucker!<br /><br />END",

Amir holds up a scroll.]<br /><br />JAKE: No. No.<br /><br />[Jake begins throwing things from his desk at Amir. Amir uses the scroll to deflect them as he unrolls it.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey. Hey. No. Stop it.<br /><br />AMIR: [deflecting a pad of Post-it notes] \"Top Ten Fish to Fry\", by Rodrigo O! [enunciating \"O\" as a strange moan]<br /><br />JAKE: Was that noise your new last name?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Why, oh why are interested in frying fish?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number ten: Could I borrow a pen?\" [deflecting a pen] \"So I could write down the name of this fish, ya bish! Makes girls sad, squirrels mad, and men grin! Look no further than the almighty... penguin.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Not a fish.<br /><br />AMIR: Not a bird!<br /><br />JAKE: You think anything that's not a bird is a fish? [Amir nods.] And yes, it is. It's a flightless bird.<br /><br />AMIR: That's a fightless turd.<br /><br />[Jake is speechless.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number nine: a sashimi is fine. You don't have to fry your really old dish. Just go to McDonald's and get a Filet-O-Fish.<br /><br />JAKE: So what are you saying? The number nine fish to fry is a...?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a sashimi.<br /><br />JAKE: So not frying a fish, but then getting a fried fish--<br /><br />AMIR: Um, yeah, a Filet-O-Fish.<br /><br />JAKE: --at McDonald's.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number eight: Fill your plate. When this fat fish died, we ate catfish, fried! But don't let this mustachian fool you. This fish is all woman... and a crustacean drool cube.\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...How are you getting dumber?<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE: Stop saying that. I've asked you.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Fair. \"Number seven: A Bacon named Kevin. That's right, this Footloose star has gone too far! I say we dip him in oil, and serve him to a horde of angry fans.\"<br /><br />JAKE: That's cannibalism!<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? Forget it. What has Kevin Bacon done that's gone too far? ...Please just done your work.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Done your work\"!<br /><br />JAKE: \"Do your work,\" I said.<br /><br />AMIR: [doing a Southern accent] \"Done your work!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Done your work. Do your work.<br /><br />AMIR: [still doing an accent] \"Hey, you over there! Let's all done our work--\"<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, I misspoke. You just said \"crustacean drool cube\", on purpose.<br /><br />[Amir quietly turns his attention to the scroll.]<br /><br />JAKE: Back to the list.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number six: Put your halibut on sticks. No need to fry it; that's bad for your diet. Not to mention it'll clog your arteries, and make you smell like a fartery. Pee-yew.\" [pause, then, pronouncing \"PU\"] \"Poo.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Pee-yew, poo\".<br /><br />[Amir chuckles.]<br /><br />JAKE: So twice on this list of top ten fish to fry, you've suggested not frying the fish. Once, you suggested we fry and eat Kevin Bacon--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Kevin Bacon.<br /><br />JAKE: I mean, what is wrong with you? [Amir doesn't respond.] This is so bizarre. Why is this our interaction? It's come to this.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number--\"<br /><br />JAKE: You've run out of ideas, haven't you.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number five...\"<br /><br />JAKE: You really have.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number five\". \"Number five is Ryan Gosling, starred in Drive--\"<br /><br />JAKE: So you want to fry and eat him as well.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding out his hand to interrupt Jake] Jumping to conclusions. \"What was his favorite fried fish, at the craft services table?\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...I don't know!<br /><br />AMIR: Do you not? ...Neither do I. I was hoping you'd, uh... [making a hopping motion with his hand] ...jump in right there with that.<br /><br />JAKE: Are you kidding me? What a weird hand motion.<br /><br />[Amir makes the motion a few more times. It looks progressively less like jumping.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...God, I hate your fingers.<br /><br />AMIR: Never matter. It's probably, like, lox or something.<br /><br />JAKE: Not a fried fish.<br /><br />AMIR: You think Gosling eats fried fish? Ya fucking idiot, he's an Adonis!<br /><br />JAKE: You said! You said, \"What's his favorite fried fish?\"<br /><br />AMIR: Gosling's on a strict no-fried-fish diet. You know it, I know it--<br /><br />JAKE: Now you know what he eats.<br /><br />AMIR: --the American people know it.<br /><br />JAKE: A second ago, you had no idea what he ate. Now you know whether he doesn't eat fried fish.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number four...\"<br /><br />JAKE: So why'd you include him on the list?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Drop your bass to the floor!\" [singing to the tune of \"Anaconda\" by Nicki Minaj] \"My big piranha don't want naan unless you fry that bun! Oh my cod. Look at that cut. Oh my cod. I like halibut--\"<br /><br />[Jake throws a pencil at Amir. Amir doesn't deflect it. The pencil stabs him in the throat and stays there.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Holy shit.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three: Is it dim in here, or is it just me?\"<br /><br />JAKE: I am sorry...<br /><br />AMIR: It's fine. \"Haddock--\" ...\"Haddock is--\" ...\"Number three...\"<br /><br />JAKE: We have to go to a hospital.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll go in a bit. \"Number two? Nah. It's tuna. Forget tilapia, whitefish, and speck. A deep-fried tuna... will help you forget the pain in your neck.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Did you know this was gonna happen?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a fortunate coincidence. \"Number one: This pencil's no fun.\"<br /><br />JAKE: You're absolutely freestyling.<br /><br />[Amir turns the scroll around. The one thing written on it is \"1. This pencil's no fun. :( -Rodrigo O!\"]<br /><br />JAKE: ...You wizard. You warlock.<br /><br />AMIR: \"I taste only blood, perhaps a bit of lead. Soon the fried fish won't be all whom are dead. My friend did this to me, he's a murderous beast.

After a few seconds, he seems to notice the viewer, curiously narrowing his eyes directly at the camera. Amir comes in and sits beside Jake, distracting him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Hey bub. Mind if I pitch you some painting ideas?<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: I'll take that as a no...<br /><br />JAKE: Great.<br /><br />AMIR: ...but I don't take no for an answer! Scoot over!<br /><br />JAKE: You're already sitting.<br /><br />AMIR: You're taking up the whole couch!<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, have you ever seen a painting of just, like, a fucking field? Not even of people. Just a landscape.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Of course.<br /><br />AMIR: [taken aback] Ow, that hurts...<br /><br />JAKE: You thought you were the first person ever to come up with the idea of painting nature?<br /><br />AMIR: Never mind, I said.<br /><br />JAKE: When did you say \"never mind\"? You just said it for the first time now.<br /><br />AMIR: [nodding] Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: What's the gayest part of painting?<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing.<br /><br />AMIR: [waving his hand] That you do it with a brush.<br /><br />JAKE: Homophobic. Dumb.<br /><br />AMIR: Which is why I'm using this. [holds up a palette with paint]<br /><br />JAKE: You have paint. What would you use to get it on the canvas?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Oh, no!<br /><br />AMIR: See if you can wrap your fat little Jew cock around this idea: It's a portrait painting of a woman. [pauses] ...Hmm? Thoughts?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: Has it been done?<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, what if I forgo the canvas, and just straight up paint on a building?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, that's street art. That's pretty fun. Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: That's not fun, if it's been done!<br /><br />JAKE: That's an awful slogan, and a bad way to live your life. It insinuates that nobody but you can have a good idea.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right.<br /><br />JAKE: Yet all of your ideas so far have been unoriginal.<br /><br />AMIR: Forget it, I said!<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't! You never said what you said you said. I don't think I've ever seen you say what you said you said.<br /><br />AMIR: You know, what the big issue is is that I was born too late, so all the good shit's already been done.<br /><br />JAKE: How dare you? You have every modern convenience. I mean, this is probably the only era that you could survive in--<br /><br />AMIR: I would have killed it in Egypt, as a slave. Did you know, actually, here's a-- ...I came up with the pyramids.<br /><br />AMIR: What about a dude?<br /><br />JAKE: Is your goal to paint something totally original?<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: That's never been painted before?<br /><br />AMIR: That's right.<br /><br />JAKE: And your first three ideas were a dude--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Dude.<br /><br />JAKE: --a girl--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] A girl.<br /><br />JAKE: --and a landscape.<br /><br />AMIR: Nature, yeah. Nature landscape.<br /><br />JAKE: Bad. You're bad.<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] There will be the sun, let it be...!<br /><br />JAKE: Great.

Correct.<br /><br />JAKE: ...before-- independently of those things--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Of the Beatles. Yeah, exactly.<br /><br />JAKE: Got it. Okay, anything else?

Gid.<br /><br />AMIR: Gid!<br /><br />JAKE: That's the final answer?<br /><br />AMIR: Gid!<br /><br />JAKE: Twelve minus three. You want to say gid?<br /><br />AMIR: G, I, D.<br /><br />JAKE: [at the same time] D. Perfect. You're wrong. Alright, so guess what? You're losing your adult teeth...<br /><br />[Amir smiles quickly.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...you eat like, and kind of resemble, a squirrel.<br /><br />[Amir is gnawing on an acorn.]<br /><br />JAKE: Kind of really resemble a squirrel. I mean, that's an acorn. And when I ask you a simple math question, you reply with a noise. Not a number, and not a word.<br /><br />AMIR: Gid is a word.<br /><br />JAKE: It's, of course, not a word.<br /><br />AMIR: Wanna bet?<br /><br />JAKE: Sure, yeah. Let's bet. If gid's not a word, you get rid of the compost bin.<br /><br />AMIR: And if it is a word, then I keep the compost, and you eat what's inside!<br /><br />JAKE: Sounds great.<br /><br />[Jake does an internet search. Amir watches expectantly.]<br /><br />JAKE: [bitterly] ...Get back to work. Jackass.<br /><br />AMIR: Is it a word?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it is. Congrats, dummy. You've accidentally stumbled upon a word.<br /><br />AMIR Then you have to eat my compost.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I don't. I'm not gonna eat what's in that disgusting bin.<br /><br />AMIR: We made a bet!<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry about that, man. But I'll tell you what, hey, if you're upset, you can suck it!<br /><br />AMIR: ...What?<br /><br />[Jake stands up and does the crotch chop taunt.]<br /><br />JAKE: Suck it.<br /><br />AMIR: Murph!<br /><br />JAKE: No, no n-n-n-no!

[throwing up a peace sign] What's up, man?<br /><br />MURPH: A lot is up. Amir said you reneged on a bet.<br /><br />JAKE: How do you know so fast?<br /><br />MURPH: Because we're tight.<br /><br />[Amir nods.]<br /><br />MURPH: What was the bet, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Honestly, it wasn't even a bet. It was just a-- we were just having a funny conversation. Alright? That was it. And if you'll leave me alone, I won't be afraid. My aunt's birthday is today, she's turning fifty-one, we have a nice little--<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] What--<br /><br />[Jake jumps, and shakes in fear.]<br /><br />MURPH: ...was the bet, Jake?<br /><br />AMIR: He bet me gid wasn't a word, and it is a word.<br /><br />MURPH: Of course gid is a word. It's a disease found in sheep.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, fair enough. But he's making compost at the office. Alright? He's keeping filthy, weird, smelly soil here at work, and that's not okay, so... so I have an idea: why don't we team up? Me and you. One time. Jake and Murph. We'll make him afraid of us. [extends his hand for a shake]<br /><br />MURPH: Composting is an energy-efficient way to recycle and garden. It's plenty okay. What's not okay is reneging on bets. Now what were the stakes?<br /><br />JAKE: It was twenty dollars. Twenty-dollar iTunes gift card. And I'm gonna pony it up. I really will. And... sucks for my aunt, 'cause she's not gonna have a birthday gift, but--<br /><br />AMIR: Bull! He said he was gonna eat what was inside the compost!<br /><br />JAKE: Weak!<br /><br />[Amir hands the compost bin over to Murph, who takes out a piece of moldy bread.]<br /><br />MURPH: [making airplane noises] Here comes the airplane! Bread Blue, Flight 69!<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] Nice!<br /><br />JAKE: [covering his mouth] Uh, sorry, Flight Bread Blue, you do not have permission to land--<br /><br />[Murph forces the bread past Jake's hand and into his mouth.]<br /><br />MURPH: Mmm, what's it taste like, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Limes.<br /><br />MURPH: Now let's get going to your aunt's shindig. I want to wish her a happy Murphday.<br /><br />JAKE: Murph, please don't. Please don't go. Murphy-- Brian!<br /><br />MURPH: [walking into the background] Where is she?<br /><br />END",

Okay, buddy? You asked for my thoughts, and now you're immediately telling--<br /><br />AMIR: Shhh!<br /><br />JAKE: You're shushing me? Are you kidding?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, because opinions are like assholes: ya are one! And they stink, and so do you!<br /><br />JAKE: Nice, you butchered that phrase!<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, why do you think you're wearing a good outfit for work?<br /><br />AMIR: Because it's healthy, dingus! My cousin Leron has a friend Chard who's a personal trainer!<br /><br />JAKE: He has a friend named Chard?<br /><br />AMIR: That's right. He's Swiss!<br /><br />JAKE: Swiss Chard.<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm!<br /><br />JAKE: Good. Go home.<br /><br />AMIR: No!<br /><br />JAKE: Go home and change.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I have to work in it!<br /><br />JAKE: You have to work in that! Wow.<br /><br />AMIR: I have to work out in it! Yeah!<br /><br />[The tracking shot ends, and Amir is revealed to be wearing a baggy silver sweat suit.]<br /><br />JAKE: You're not working out in it, you're just--<br /><br />AMIR: It doesn't matter. The one issue, honestly, is that it's a little hot. It's steamy. But--<br /><br />JAKE: That's the sole purpose of the suit. It's supposed to be a sweat suit.<br /><br />AMIR: --it is shiny. I like that it's shiny, and actually, I trust Chard.<br /><br />JAKE: You trust him?<br /><br />AMIR: I do trust Chard, because he has a record label.<br /><br />SAM: [standing in the doorway of his office] Guys! My office, now!<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are sitting in Sam's office.]<br /><br />AMIR: [doing a voice] What seems to be the problem here, officer?

Alright, we've had two auditions at least, and, um, one or two table reads as well.<br /><br />SAM: That is three to four instances of work in the last eight years.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry, let me try to wrap my cock around this: you're saying me and you are done professionally?<br /><br />JAKE: Bad joke.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] It's not a joke! It's not a joke. Not everything is a joke.<br /><br />JAKE: Are you gonna say you didn't say that hoping people would laugh?<br /><br />AMIR: Nobody did laugh, though.<br /><br />SAM: You see what you're doing? Even now you're arguing, and I'm firing you.<br /><br />AMIR: Give us one chance, dude, okay? One more opportunity. Mom's spaghetti. I swear we'll write not just one episode for you, but an entire web series... eight hundred fucking episodes.<br /><br />JAKE: Way too many.<br /><br />SAM: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: And they'll be cheap, too. Because all of them will be Jake and I, chatting.<br /><br />JAKE: [sarcastically] Awesome pitch. That sounds really good.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! It'll be me and you talking.<br /><br />JAKE: Just talking at our desks?<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm!<br /><br />JAKE: [giving Amir a thumbs-up] Yeah, I wanna watch that.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] I do!<br /><br />SAM: This could work... I mean, you did kick Jake's tongue off last year.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] See? That's an episode! Another one could be, is if I'm, uh, a mime, or... I get a dog, or, uh, if I, one c-- one could be if I have a snake or bread.<br /><br />JAKE: You're just saying nouns, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: It's all funny, though, because if it's--<br /><br />JAKE: Well focus on one episode.<br /><br />AMIR: So think ab--<br /><br />JAKE: Let's make one episode funny, rather than just finish all eight hundred--<br /><br />AMIR: N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no!<br /><br />SAM: This... is the show.<br /><br />SAM/AMIR: ...This... is the show.

I'm willing to experiment with this, but I agree with Jake.<br /><br />AMIR: Thi--<br /><br />SAM: Eight hundred episodes is too many. I mean, you can't just take the same format, and do it over and over, and over... and over.<br /><br />JAKE: That's enough.<br /><br />SAM: Let's give one a shot and see how it comes out, and take it from there.<br /><br />AMIR: Sam, I have a feeling you're gonna love the first episode of Amir and Jake!<br /><br />SAM: Hmm.

Ben Schwartz... uh... hippity-holo... hologram?<br /><br />BEN pausing, looking confused: No. (at Amir) So I'm gonna talk to you for the rest of the time, is that fine?<br /><br />AMIR: So here's the situation, CollegeHumor's asking us to write the first episode in a webseries, okay? We want it to be great, something that can potentially last for, I don't know, eight years?<br /><br />BEN: Eight years? That seems reasonable. Uuuuh, how 'bout this, I'll give you some tips.<br /><br />AMIR: That'd be great.<br /><br />BEN: Alright cool, one of the tips I'd say is maybe one of you guys is really obsessed with the other one.<br /><br />Amir points knowingly at Jake<br /><br />BEN: Is he super into you all the time? Twenty-four-seven?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br /><br />BEN: I love that, I love that!

You should have a catch phrase.<br /><br />AMIR: Ooh, I like that.<br /><br />BEN: You need one a lot like '80s or '90s television, like Urkel, in Family Matters'd be like:<br /><br />BEN: \"Did I do that?\"<br /><br />//<br /><br />JAKE: \"And I did that!\"<br /><br />BEN to Jake: No, you don't have to say it after me, and also you said it wrong. So, just for next time, it's: \"Did I do that?\"\t<br /><br />JAKE: Oh I did that!<br /><br />BEN: Stop. You don't have to repeat it after me, but just so you don't get embarrassed when you're in front of your friends, its- let's do it beat by beat: \"Did\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Did\"<br /><br />BEN: Alright, \"I\"-<br /><br />JAKE: -and I did that!<br /><br />BEN looking puzzled: No... Alright... Or like a different catch-phrase, you know what's a great one? In Cheers, every time George Wendt came into the bar they'd scream: <br /><br />BEN and AMIR: \"Norm!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Gnome!<br /><br />BEN: Norm<br /><br />JAKE: DAN!<br /><br />BEN: Stop. You can see my lips are saying \"Norm\"-<br /><br />JAKE: And I did that!<br /><br />BEN pausing: Ok, it doesn't matter<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />BEN: You know what would help us with all of this?<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />BEN: I have roommates back at home. Wanna go over there?<br /><br />AMIR: I'd be down.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah right, let me guess- the only way we can get back to your place is if you put your lips on my dick and blow me there.<br /><br />BEN looking shocked at Jake: ...nah.

You build upon things.<br /><br />[The interrogator returns.]<br /><br />INTERROGATOR: That's right, you piece of shit. So stop saying no and start saying yes! [lunges at Jake's pants]<br /><br />JAKE: Get out of here! Hey-- Ow! Get off of me, man!<br /><br />INTERROGATOR: Fine! It may be illegal now, but it won't be for long!<br /><br />JAKE: It's always gonna be against the law to do that.<br /><br />INTERROGATOR: [leaving] Oh, we'll see. My dad's in the Senate.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, look, stop it. You guys can all help. Just one idea at a time, and no blowing me.<br /><br />BEN: Oh.<br /><br />AMIR: Or...<br /><br />BEN: Or?<br /><br />AMIR: ...everyone pitch their ideas at the same time and we get out of here fifty times quicker.<br /><br />BEN: So smart. Let's do that. I'll get my laptop. Let's go over here.<br /><br />JAKE: Not smart. It's actually a dumb idea.<br /><br />[Amir follows Ben and makes a two-person conga line.]<br /><br />BEN: [sitting down at his laptop] Everybody, on your marks, get set, go!<br /><br />[All of Ben's roommates begin talking over each other. Most of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony.]<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Fade up, on Charles Crooshtoost...<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: Open on a movie theater...<br /><br />CHERRY DUDE: ...in Wilshire. There he is...<br /><br />JOPE: ...What are they doing? They're trying to...<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: [singing] ...Hail to the milkman, the milkman, the milkman! Hail to the milkman, the milkman is me!...<br /><br />SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: ...never been stretched before. What are these called? Elbows...<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: ...all the snacks to themselves! What am I gonna do? How am I gonna do it?...<br /><br />STANLEY: ...and strikes the defender! \"Whoa, cow,\" he says, \"whoa!\"<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: ...What are we gonna do?...<br /><br />[Ben and Amir both type on the computer, and Amir laughs maniacally at what they're writing.]<br /><br />[A title card reads \"4 Hours Later\". Jake has toweled the milk off his face.]<br /><br />BEN: Done! ...Perfect, we did it!<br /><br />JAKE: No it's not. I didn't get a word in edgewise, guys. How many pages is this thing?<br /><br />BEN: Yeah-- it is... four hundred and two pages, but, to be fair, it is double-sided.<br /><br />JAKE: That is 804, then.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah, but you know what? I just double-checked it: it's way over a thousand.<br /><br />AMIR: That's okay. It's better to have over a thousand pages of garbage than four pages of gold.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Completely disagree.<br /><br />BEN: Hey, what do you guys say about a wrap party, huh?<br /><br />[Ben hits a key, and Stony's remix \"The Milkman\" begins playing. Scalbylausus Jim and Sulu Candles start dancing, and Charles Crooshtoost mouths along to the words.]<br /><br />JAKE: [as Ben and Amir dance] How is this possible? These are sound clips from our actual lives.<br /><br />[A montage begins, set to \"The Milkman\", featuring outtakes from all of the episodes in which Ben Schwartz appeared.]<br /><br />LYRICS: (as in the video)  <br /><br />Listen up, everybody, this is the guy  <br /><br />That sucked my dick, sucked my dick<br /><br />Milkman please, milkman please  <br /><br />A glass of your least expired milk  <br /><br />Absolutely, I have July 13th (That's good, that's good)  <br /><br />1991 (Mmm, even better)<br /><br />Listen up, everybody, this is the guy  <br /><br />That sucked my dick, sucked my dick  <br /><br />(Listen up, everybody!)

Ben goes to Jake for a hug, but dips down toward Jake's crotch at the last second.]<br /><br />JAKE: No, no!<br /><br />BEN: Yeah, yeah, of course.<br /><br />END",

Jake is waiting inside.]<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry! Couldn't find a meter spot to save my life! I had to valet like a chumpwad.<br /><br />JAKE: There is no valet. Why are you wearing that?<br /><br />AMIR: [jutting his golf bag out] Golf clubs!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you think I said \"What are you wearing\"? I said \"Why\".<br /><br />AMIR: I'm trying to be relatable, dimwit. You know, this is actually a pretty big problem you have: You often reject my shit at the face without really trying to understand and grasp the subtle nuance behind it. Zoom out!<br /><br />JAKE: We're meeting with high-power producers, trying to get them to give us money to fund the insane script that you wrote. The least you can do is act like a professional.<br /><br />AMIR: [imitating Christian Bale] Are you professional?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Stop with the Christian Bale shit.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry!<br /><br />JAKE: It happened--<br /><br />AMIR: I just learned about it.<br /><br />[The two producers, later referred to as Lyle and Blanche, show up. Lyle shakes hands with Amir.]<br /><br />LYLE: Blumenfeld! Didn't know you golfed. Good man! What's your handicap?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm actually dyslexic.<br /><br />[Lyle laughs.]<br /><br />BLANCHE: I like this kid.<br /><br />LYLE: [pointing to the table] Yeah, we're back here...<br /><br />AMIR: It's pretty bad, actually.<br /><br />[At the table, Jake pitches the show.]<br /><br />JAKE: So... yes, it's low-concept, but what's exciting is developing the characters over time.<br /><br />BLANCHE: Well. I'm bored.<br /><br />AMIR: So am I. Blanche, Lyle, I apologize for my... insanely boring colleague. He doesn't realize that from him, even a little bit is too much.<br /><br />BLANCHE: Agreed.<br /><br />AMIR: But pass me the conch. [holding up his hand, which is in an actual conch] Allow me to beat your eardrums for just a minute here...<br /><br />LYLE: Please. Your friend is tedious.<br /><br />JAKE: Enough, Lyle.<br /><br />AMIR: My father was a quiet man. Proud. Growing up, we moved... a lot. I actually caught him one early, early morning, packing up our things -- plates, cups and whatnot -- and I told him \"Papa...\" [breaking from his story] Chinese fire drill! Chinese fire drill!<br /><br />JAKE: You--<br /><br />[Amir, Lyle and Blanche all get up and begin running around the table and laughing. Amir chases the other two.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get ya!<br /><br />[They go to sit back down. Lyle smacks Jake in the head.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ow, Lyle.<br /><br />BLANCHE: I feel young again!<br /><br />LYLE: We're prepared to write you a check, right now, for fifty thousand dollars.<br /><br />AMIR: This brunch is over. I'm sorry, but we reject your offer. It's not only a drop in the bucket, but it's a slap in the face. Lyle, you've underplayed your hand!<br /><br />LYLE: Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you knew how to play hardball. Can't blame an old exec for trying!<br /><br />AMIR: But you can teach one new tricks.<br /><br />[Lyle and Blanche laugh at length.]<br /><br />JAKE: It wasn't that good.<br /><br />BLANCHE: A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, cash in hand. All we want is to approve the outline.<br /><br />[Blanche hands a duffel bag to Amir, who immediately gives it to Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake. Count this cash.<br /><br />[Jake opens up the bag. It is full of bills.]<br /><br />AMIR: Though I'll tell you right now we're not accepting it, because we want complete creative control, Lyle!<br /><br />[Amir lights a match and throws it into the bag. Jake puts it out with a wad of bills.]<br /><br />AMIR: We want full fucking autonomy, Blanche.<br /><br />[Amir throws another match, which Jake puts out.]<br /><br />JAKE: Stop doing that.<br /><br />LYLE: That's absurd. There has to be some oversight!<br /><br />AMIR: The only oversight here is you, Lyle. As in: I'm over the sight... of your jowly face. [to Blanche] Of your... old pussy. I bid you guys namaste, I bid you guys adieu, I bid you all arrive-door-cheese. Jake, hand them the blood money back, please.<br /><br />LYLE: Keep it. Good luck, Amir. Oh, and Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah?<br /><br />LYLE: You really fucking suck.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, and Blanche?<br /><br />[Amir and Blanche both abruptly stand up, looking intensely into each other's eyes. They lean in slowly for a kiss.]<br /><br />AMIR: No... you misread this.<br /><br />[Amir stands up straight and leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: Valet!<br /><br />JAKE: Your car was stolen.<br /><br />AMIR: Right.<br /><br />END",

Let's do it one more time.<br /><br />JAKE: Nope, we're good.<br /><br />AMIR: All rice.<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are sitting on a couch.]<br /><br />AMIR: [directly to the viewer] Casting is important. In a way, it determines which actors play which parts.<br /><br />JAKE: The last thing I said to you was \"casting is important; it determines which actors play which parts\". You just regurgitated that back to me, adding \"in a way\", which made it incorrect.<br /><br />AMIR: Let's watch the tapes.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine.<br /><br />[We see that Jake and Amir have set up a TV to watch the audition tapes. Rick Fox has sent one in. Amir points excitedly at the TV and looks at Jake.]<br /><br />RICK FOX: This is, uh, three-time NBA champion Rick Fox, auditioning for the role of Amir's bookie. Oh, and... another note: I am not a chicken, my wife's not a chicken, and my kids are not eggs... alright--<br /><br />[Clucking noises come from off-screen.]<br /><br />RICK FOX: Baby! I'm auditioning!

Yeah, right! [laughs] And I'm not-- ...I don't know the correlation, like, which one makes it s-- I know he is Shia.<br /><br />[Next is Streeter Seidell's tape.]<br /><br />STREETER: Hey guys! Uh, what a fun idea! I'm just gettin' the sides here now... Uh, [adopting a British accent] so this is Streeter Seidell, auditioning for the role, [laughs, drops the accent, then looks at the script] of Eater Pie-Fell. Eater P-- what the fuck, guys!<br /><br />AMIR: Ah, no. I bet he loves this, actually, 'cause his tears taste salty, and he'll just eat it.<br /><br />STREETER: [crying, eating a whole pie] You did this to me! I can't believe I'm gonna send this in! Why would I send this in?<br /><br />[Next is Sarah Schneider's tape.]<br /><br />SARAH: Hey guys! So happy you thought of me for the role of [air quotes] \"Sexy Babe That Makes Out with Jake Hard\"...<br /><br />[Jake grins at Amir.]<br /><br />SARAH: ...but there's no way I want that part. Bye!<br /><br />JAKE/AMIR: [simultaneously] Fuck!<br /><br />[Next is Hoodie Allen's tape.]<br /><br />HOODIE: Hi, uh, this is Hoodie Allen, reading for the role of Amir's rap teacher. Thank you.<br /><br />[Amir gives a thumbs-up to the projector screen.]<br /><br />HOODIE: [rapping] Part of the darkness, I'm harder than dark, miss. Nowhere a family, but a dog's gotta bark, sis! Colder than cold; merry aardvark jizzmas. Jizzin' on you until you're jizzless.<br /><br />JAKE: Weird rap.<br /><br />HOODIE: This is amazing. Poignant, too. I need this role.<br /><br />AMIR: I think he nailed it.<br /><br />[Next is Doobs's tape.]<br /><br />DOOBS: Hello.<br /><br />[Amir gasps.]<br /><br />DOOBS: [with dogs in his lap now] My name is Cock-Smoke Dingleberry Tiny Penis All-Male Orgy Fudge out of a Hole into Your Own Mouth Anthony Smith.

[points at one of the dogs] ...a dog.<br /><br />JAKE: How is this happening? It was pre-recorded!<br /><br />DOOBS: I won't be auditioning for the part of... Doobs...<br /><br />AMIR: What? No! You can't go off-book!<br /><br />DOOBS: I'll be auditioning for the part of Amir's father's tiny, slithery, withered legs!<br /><br />AMIR: What?

[to the dog] Do something!<br /><br />AMIR: Die, you beautiful bastard!<br /><br />DOOBS: No, Amir! Not like this!

He dances along to the ringtone.]<br /><br />JAKE: Don't get that.<br /><br />[Amir answers.]<br /><br />AMIR: Mickey, my friend! Yup, we just reviewed your tape, Mickey.<br /><br />JAKE: No we didn't.<br /><br />AMIR: You know what we thought, Mickey? I'll tell you what we thought, Mickey. Uh, we thought the same thing Olivier thought when he discovered Brando, Mickey: that we feel like we have a star on our hands, and we don't want to fuck it up, Mickey! Mickey, there is so much untapped potential within you, Mickey! I had no idea, Mickey! [crying] I just... I want to do you proud, Mickey, because I know you'll do us proud. That's why, Mickey! In fact, we just got off the phone with your manager, your agent, and your lawyer. They held our feet to the flame, and we gave in a hundred and ten percent! You got points on the back end, Mickey! [laughs] You got points on the front end! My lawyer didn't know what to do with himself! He was beside himself, Mickey! And I said as soon as you see what-- what I saw in this guy that I had known for my entire life, Mickey, I just-- I had no idea, Mickey! It was beautiful to see, Mickey, this transformation! When did you vacation in a cocoon and emerge as a beautiful butterfly, Mickey? Go to deadline.com, Mickey. Go to deadline.com right now, Mickey. It's a Hollywood-style gossip blogzine, Mickey, and you, my friend, are on the front page. The picture they used is a little outdated, but the headline is very much so loud and clear: Hollywood's New A-List Celeb! You're the talk of the town, Mickey! You know why, Mickey? 'Cause you're the star of our fucking short, Mickey! You're the star of our new web series, do you see it? You don't see it yet? G-- hit Refresh, Mickey! Command-R, Mickey? Maybe hold down Shift while you refresh, Mickey, so that it busts the cache, Mickey? Still nothin', huh, Mickey? You know why, Mickey? 'Cause it's not on deadline.com, Mickey! 'Cause we d-- ...because you sucked, Mickey! Your read was flat, Mickey, it was uninspired, Mickey, and you're frankly not that good of an actor, Mickey! Truth be told, we didn't even review your fucking tape, Mickey, that's how sure I am that ya suck, Mickey! Goodbye, Mickey! Goodbye forever... Mickey!<br /><br />[Amir hangs up.]<br /><br />[On the other end, we see Mickey, played by Ed Helms. Mickey hangs up the phone.]<br /><br />MICKEY: [laughs] Oh, Amir. You get me every time...<br /><br />[Mickey starts crying.]<br /><br />MICKEY: Come on, Mickey! ...Get it together, man... don't let him suck you in again.<br /><br />[Mickey sits silently in his office.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna miss that guy.<br /><br />END",

[punches the food] Boo-ya!<br /><br />MARISA: What are you doing?<br /><br />AMIR: I'll tell you guys what I'm doing: I'm about to cook you guys a legit feast. Huh? How's that sound?<br /><br />JAKE: We have a feast, okay? You're ruining it.<br /><br />AMIR: No, no, no, no no no. It's not a date until I make my famous crepes!

I'm making you Cornish hens instead. That's right, an after-dinner bird, and it's gonna be delicious. [putting the birds directly on the stove element] Here we go, all right, one time! Hey Cliff, how's that sound, man? Ever had a frickin' turkey for dessert before? [laughs] Okay, which one of these is fire? [fumbling with the knobs]<br /><br />[The screen reads \"GEARS OF WAR 3\"; \"SEPTEMBER 20\"; \"WORLDWIDE\".]<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are sitting at the table. Amir raises his hand for a high five.]<br /><br />JAKE: Not gonna high five you.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright. I wouldn't, just 'cause I've been touching raw meat.<br /><br />[The video closes off with the Xbox and Microsoft logos.]",

Amir has a megaphone.]<br /><br />AMIR: [patting Jake on the knee] Good shoot, as they say! Good shoot!<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please not? Alright? That was an absolutely harrowing experience.<br /><br />AMIR: Nobody said making art would be easy.<br /><br />JAKE: You cut off your own dick today, man.<br /><br />AMIR: [through the megaphone] Excuse...?<br /><br />JAKE: You stepped out of your trailer in front of a huge plume of crystal meth smoke. You strode onto the set, put your penis through the slate, and said \"'The Entire Crew Screams and Calls 911', take two,\" and slammed the device on your shaft. Your genitals hit the floor with a sickening slap, and everyone stood in stunned silence for an eternity.<br /><br />[Amir accidentally sets off the megaphone's siren, but turns it off. Jake snatches it away from him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh!<br /><br />JAKE: You never stopped smiling through the whole entire thing, even as you bled out through the stump on your mound, even as the paramedics arrived, and failed to reattach your reproductive organ. You kept yelling, \"I'll be a better director as a eunuch! My libido won't guide my eye!\"<br /><br />[Amir gestures along as Jake quotes him, raising his arms for emphasis and then pointing at his eye.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry if I went dickless for Michael Chiklis. I'm serious. [air quotes] I apologize if I \"inconvenienced anybody\".<br /><br />JAKE: You inconvenienced everybody. Eventually, you convinced the paramedics to attach your big toe to your pelvic bone to use as your phallus. You said \"as long as it's chubby, a girl will rubby\". I will never forget that weird rhyme as long as I live.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh... Thank you--<br /><br />JAKE: Not a compliment. You also rented an IMAX camera, for no reason. That's a hundred thousand dollars, for the day, out of our budget, and you didn't even shoot anything interesting! You laid it on the ground, and paraded a bunch of construction paper dinosaurs around in front of it.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding a paper pterodactyl out in front of him] Welcome, to Jurassic Shart?<br /><br />JAKE: So dumb. Don't--<br /><br />[Amir grunts and squirms for a long time, and shits without farting. He throws the pterodactyl down in frustration.]<br /><br />JAKE: Great. You shit your pants without farting. So it's not even a shart; it's just a shit.<br /><br />AMIR: [frustrated] Anal!<br /><br />JAKE: What are you gonna do without a penis?<br /><br />AMIR: Let me ask: Why are you so fixated on that small part of the day?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Fixated on that\"... it's a small part of you.<br /><br />AMIR: A lot of other stuff happened, by the way!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? I'm fixated because you castrated yourself publicly!<br /><br />AMIR: [sarcastically] Oooooh!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah! Yeah, you ruined today! We didn't get any good footage!<br /><br />AMIR: It's there in pieces!<br /><br />JAKE: Your penis is in pieces!<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse you! Absolutely excuse you!<br /><br />JAKE: Excuse you. You monster.<br /><br />AMIR: By the way, whatever we didn't get today, we pick up tomorrow! That's why it's called a pick-up!<br /><br />JAKE: What money do we shoot the pick-ups with? You blew the entire budget! A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars gone, spent on an IMAX camera and a lunch comprised entirely of bird's nest soup! It's a Chinese delicacy. It cost forty-five hundred dollars a bowl, which of course meant we didn't even get to feed the entire crew of fifty people.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up a finger to stop Jake] I had a KIND bar.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh good! Good, so you ate.<br /><br />AMIR: I had a KIND bar--<br /><br />JAKE: You also had soup!<br /><br />AMIR: --and soup! I had a KIND bar and soup, which I think is f--<br /><br />JAKE: How is that fair? Other people didn't eat anything at all!<br /><br />AMIR: Let's talk post-production for a second.<br /><br />JAKE: Insane.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm thinking in terms of editing, I can cut the bitch up myself.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to--<br /><br />AMIR: I mean, I do have iMovie.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to edit?<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Suck my fuckin' toe, dude!<br /><br />JAKE: Good, good reaction.<br /><br />[Amir unzips his pants and whips out his relocated big toe.]<br /><br />AMIR: Suck my toe!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh! Oh, it's wiggling!<br /><br />END",

She's a ten!<br /><br />[Amir and Angie laugh.]<br /><br />ANGIE: So what's your movie about?<br /><br />AMIR: It's actually not a movie--<br /><br />JAKE: [talking over Amir] \"--a movie,\" is what he was gonna say. \"It's actually not--\" ...Fuck me!... Shit ass!<br /><br />JAKE: Hollyweird? No, this is Hollywild. As in anything goes. [doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impression] And I am Arnold. I am the Governator.<br /><br />[Jake flexes his bicep and grins.]<br /><br />ANGIE: Oh, you have a seed in your teeth.<br /><br />JAKE: [picking his teeth] Okay. I had a bagel at home for dinner. Everything on it.<br /><br />AMIR: You had an everything bagel?<br /><br />JAKE: No! Listen to the story, ass. I had a plain bagel; I put everything on it. The whole shabazz. I had lox.<br /><br />ANGIE: So just lox.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Just--<br /><br />AMIR: Then why do you have a seed?<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you two ganging up on me right now? You guys know Gangnam Style, right? I feel like this is Ganging Style! [raising his hands to do the Gangnam Style dance] Oppa Ganging Style!<br /><br />[Angie punches Jake in the face.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh! Ohh! You struck me!<br /><br />ANGIE: So it's not a movie? ...So what's the TV show, then?<br /><br />JAKE: Not a TV show either. It's much better than both of those things, alright? This is the internet.  You ever heard of a YouTube? ...This show's gonna be on one.<br /><br />ANGIE: I thought you said this was a premiere.<br /><br />JAKE: I said a lot of things, okay? I said I was Adam Lambert's cousin Drew! But that-- does that mean you wouldn't be coming on this date with me if I weren't rich, connected, and famous? It's like--<br /><br />[Angie opens the door of the limo and jumps out. Sounds of car horns and swerving can be heard off-screen.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ohh!<br /><br />JAKE: No! N-- ohh, freak-- come on!<br /><br />[Jake is snorting something off his wrist.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh!<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa! Was that cocaine?<br /><br />JAKE: Nah, dude. Powdered sugar. But we gotta get used to snorting something!<br /><br />JAKE: [yelling out the door of the limo] Get in the car. Angie, come on. Look, I really am cousins with Lambert, Angie! Yeah! His mom is my dad's brother's wife. Y-- ...it's not by blood, you're right, Angie. Just get in the car-- get in the goddamn c--<br /><br />JAKE: Do you even know how many dates I've had jump from moving friggin' cars on my ass?<br /><br />AMIR: Five?<br /><br />JAKE: Good guess. Four. It's still, like... it's still a lot. It's still too much, 'cause I've been on, like, six dates in the past couple years, and four of them j-- five, if you count her.<br /><br />JAKE: Driver! Ass! Will you please pull over for three goddamn seconds! Okay? So I can stay in one Tinder radius? Our date literally just bailed on us.<br /><br />AMIR: Us?<br /><br />JAKE: I was gonna offer you a menage.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />[Jake nods.]<br /><br />AMIR: Nooo!<br /><br />JAKE: Nooo!<br /><br />JAKE/AMIR: [simultaneously] Nooo!<br /><br />JAKE: Hello?

Well gee whiz, why don't I put you on the phone with Adam Lambert's cousin.<br /><br />[Amir motions for Jake to give him the phone and let him do the voice. Jake pushes him away.]<br /><br />JAKE: [barely disguising his voice] Hello, Drew speaking.<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] Nice.<br /><br />JAKE: Hel-- ...they hung up... they hung up... because of you!

Alright, come on, dude, we're here! Let's do this!<br /><br />AMIR: What are you doing?<br /><br />JAKE: Reader's Digest calls it \"disheveled after-party look\", the style of mid-2015. Or was Wilmer Valderrama at his accountant's twin sons' b'nai mitzvah not styling?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Disheveled after-party look\"?<br /><br />JAKE: A messed-up tux for these dumb fucks makes the ladies go \"yuck!\" ...I tossed the salad of a duck. At a dayve.<br /><br />AMIR: A dayve?<br /><br />JAKE: Day rave, dude. The second-coolest kind of rave.<br /><br />AMIR: How much sugar did you snort?<br /><br />JAKE: You know, it was a lot, and I also skipped dinner. I lied about the bagel, lied about the lox.

The marquee outside reads \"COLLEGEHUMOR PRESENTS: AMIR AND JAKE; A WEBSERIES ABOUT TWO BEST FRIENDS\". Inside, Amir and Jake walk across the stage into the spotlight. The are met with applause from an audience of their co-workers.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ladies... gentlemen... Paul...<br /><br />[Murph, who is sitting beside Paul Briganti, laughs uproariously.]<br /><br />PAUL: ...Why are you mean to me?<br /><br />AMIR: What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />SAM: Uh, excuse me: \"movie\"? It's supposed to be a short web clip.<br /><br />AMIR: Started off as that. But the more we worked on it, the more this bird wanted to be a plump, plump princess, a tubby fowl.<br /><br />JAKE: It's off to, you know, a little bit of a rough start, but I think with some patience, Sam, I really think we can... we can find our voice.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] It has full frontal!... It has full backal!<br /><br />JAKE: It's quirky. That's true. But I believe we can find some dedicated weirdos to laugh along with us.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] I'm a dumbass! I'm a dumbass extraordinaire, and I was in charge of making it, and then I, I did it!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. I play Jake, uh, everyday straight man...<br /><br />[Amir waves.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...opposite my annoying co-worker, Amir.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] I play me: Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: You play Amir.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] Henry!<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] You're getting overly excited. [to the audience] Alright, Amir plays an over-the-top--<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling and shaking] --demented dumbass Jew with a black heart and a raisin toe dick, who gets off to making Jake proud and nothing else!<br /><br />JAKE: Calm down, please.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling, shaking] I am calm!<br /><br />JAKE: You're shaking.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling, shaking] I love being in front of people! I'm famous today! [stomps]<br /><br />SAM: [to himself] What have I done...<br /><br />JAKE: We've taken up enough of your time. We'll just let you guys enjoy the movie.<br /><br />[Jake walks off-stage, dragging along Amir, who is still vibrating with energy.]<br /><br />AMIR: [still yelling] Yeah! In the beginning is when I cut my dick off in it!<br /><br />[As the movie plays, Jake and Amir stay backstage. Jake is waiting nervously, but Amir has begun doing his celebratory dance.]<br /><br />AMIR: Henry!... Henry!...<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please stop celebrating? We don't even know how it's going in there.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sure it's doing great!<br /><br />[Sam enters the backstage area.]<br /><br />SAM: Alright guys! You are fired.<br /><br />JAKE: Of course.<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Why?<br /><br />SAM: I just saw you amputate your penis... asshole!<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Why did you leave that in?<br /><br />AMIR: It's art!<br /><br />SAM: What the fuck is \"backal\"?<br /><br />[In the theater, the audience can be heard groaning loudly in disgust.]<br /><br />AMIR: Probably just missed it!<br /><br />[Pat runs into the backstage area and bee-lines for the trash can to vomit. The lid only opens once he has finished throwing up, splattering his vomit on the back wall.]<br /><br />PAT: I can never unsee that.<br /><br />[Pat walks away, staring daggers at Jake and Amir as he leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: It is memorable. Agreed.<br /><br />SAM: Yeah, you guys are done at CollegeHumor. I might be done at CollegeHumor! I now have to distance myself from the two of you.<br /><br />[Sam walks away, only turning back to scream a few thoughts at them.]<br /><br />SAM: \"Backal\"?... Assholes! ...Fuck! ...My parents died in a plane crash!...<br /><br />[Jake and Amir have returned to the CollegeHumor building alone. They sit in the silent office, packing up their desks. Amir picks up a pen, tries to twirl it between his fingers, and fails.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Hey, do you know any pen tricks?<br /><br />JAKE: Focus on being sad. Alright? Let the feeling of failure wash over you.<br /><br />[Amir makes a defensive face to dismiss Jake. Eventually, though, he leans back meditatively in his chair and takes a deep breath, taking in the situation. He nods sadly.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...You jumped the carp tonight, man.<br /><br />JAKE: Excuse me?<br /><br />AMIR: Didn't want to say anything, [swinging the pen like a small baseball bat] but you came out swinging and whiffing! [laughs] I think we should have stuck to the original script, the original plan.<br /><br />JAKE: That's what I'm saying. [picking up the original script, tossing a copy to Amir] Look at this thing! It was so easy to produce, we could have shot it ourselves on one of these.<br /><br />[Jake holds up a small digital camera. He hands it to Amir, who studies it.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Huh.<br /><br />JAKE: Come on. What's your first line?<br /><br />[Amir clears his throat, holds the camera at arm's length to his side, and begins recording. The video they record is the 2007 Jake and Amir episode \"Beer\". During their read we see glimpses of Amir's recorded footage, which is that of the original episode.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"So drunk...\"<br /><br />JAKE: Uh-- \"You're drunk right now?\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"Last night, I got so drunk...\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Um... you-- ...nice.\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I had, like, so many beers.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"How many? How many is so many?\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I was, like, retarded.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"How many beers did you have?\"<br /><br />AMIR \"...Sixty.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Sixty? That's... sixty is way too many. That's not a believable number at all.\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I know... how many is believable?\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Twelve?\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I know. Twelve. I had twelve beers. I was... stupid afterwards.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"I don't think you even know-- I don't think you've had any beer, ever.\"<br /><br />[Amir pauses, losing motivation to continue reading.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Actually, this is pretty bad.<br /><br />AMIR: It was funny when we wrote it.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I guess so...<br /><br />[They both put their copies of the script in their boxes. Amir sighs.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...So what's next?<br /><br />[Amir pauses for a long time as he tries to think of an answer.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Dinner tonight?<br /><br />[Jake quietly contemplates Amir's offer, and takes a last look around the offices of CollegeHumor. The screen cuts to black.]<br /><br />[A credits sequence for the series plays, set to My Chemical Romance's \"Black Parade\" (in the CollegeHumor upload, an instrumental song is used). Clips, outtakes, and behind-the-scenes footage plays behind the text.]<br /><br />JAKE AND AMIR<br /><br />[Outtakes of Jake and Amir cracking up, as well as clips from \"Song\" of Jake and Amir lip-syncing \"Black Parade\" (in the CollegeHumor upload, the latter is absent).]<br /><br />WITH  <br /><br />JAKE HURWITZ<br /><br />AND  <br /><br />AMIR BLUMENFELD<br /><br />[Behind-the-scenes footage of Jon and Giancarlo filming.]<br /><br />SHOT BY  <br /><br />JON GRIMM<br /><br />AND  <br /><br />GIANCARLO FIORENTINI <br /><br />[Clips and outtakes of Jake and Amir with all of their co-workers and guest stars who have appeared on and contributed to the show.]<br /><br />WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT<br /><br />MIKE SCHAUBACH  <br /><br />WHO TAUGHT US TO BE BETTER EDITORS AND PEOPLE.<br /><br />SAM REICH  <br /><br />WHO FOUGHT FOR US AND DIRECTED US.<br /><br />OUR PRODUCERS  <br /><br />JESS, SAM, ANU, DAN, STEVE, JON, AND JILL  <br /><br />WHO DID ALL OF THE HARD WORK.<br /><br />PHIL FOX  <br /><br />WHO LOGGED MORE HOURS ON OUR SHOW THAN WE DID.<br /><br />JEFF ROSENBERG  <br /><br />WHO MADE SURE OUR FIRST 500 VIDEOS PASSED THE ROSIE TEST.<br /><br />DAVE ROSENBERG  <br /><br />WHO LOOKS LIKE JEFF.
