So he's a little disappointed from a career standpoint but he's still gonna get the money from a friend.<br /><br />Jake: (laughed, stood up, deep spit breathe, sits down)<br /><br />Amir: What happened?<br /><br />Jake: Ugh, bullshit, really (background: cough cough). Uhh, didn't get the raise. Butts. You owe me nineteen hundred dollars.<br /><br />Amir: (laughed) Why is that?<br /><br />Jake: So we (background: Amir laugh)...we gotta bet.<br /><br />Amir: Nah, I was just kdding about that.<br /><br />Jake: I bet you that I wasn't gonna get a raise.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, no.

One, I'll be in the car.<br /><br />Amir: A guy who takes a drink out of his water and it taste like his own urine, and he wants to tell people that it taste like his own urine but he can't because then he would have to explain the fact that he's one drinks, that he's once drink his own pee and he doesn't wanna do that.<br /><br />Jake: (Drinking water, spits out the water) This taste...<br /><br />Amir: Like what?<br /><br />Jake: It taste like...cruUud.<br /><br />Jake: Guy who is been secretly collecting playboy magazines for twenty-five years and tries to sell them all of them on ebay without his wife knowing.<br /><br />Amir: Yes, every single issue...

'Coz if you're not gonna do it, baah then you shouldn't be holding a camera right now. I'm being serious. Like, honestly, don't even film this. I'm being completely serious right now. If you're not gonna take it seriously, I don't even wanna be part of this thing.

      "script": "Amir: All right, this is a 30 second debate between myself and Jake. Uh, Jake. What do you think about global warming? Do you think humans can slow it down or is it just an unstoppable force? Should we not even bother? Should we be like, You know what? I'm gonna drive my car and I'm gonna eat my gasoline and I'm gonna do whatever I want because I'm an american?<br /><br />Jake: Incoherent fast talking<br /><br />Amir: I can't. I can't...let's do that again. I can't hear you when you do like fast forward talking. So just talk normal.<br /><br />Jake: More fast talking<br /><br />Amir: laughs You did it again. You talked..you talked like super fast, and I can't..nobody's gonna understand you.<br /><br />Jake: More fast talking<br /><br />Amir: laughs All right, let's just...stop it. Let's just do it later, 'cause I'm..I'm running late, so I have to go anyway. (Amir turns to leave, but as he starts walking, time slows down tremendously. Amir turns around)<br /><br />Amir: Stop it! I'm seriously late! (Amir turns and leaps forward, but time has slowed again)<br /><br />Amir: You're so annoying!<br /><br />END<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Jake's fast talking can be understood when the video is slowed down.<br /><br />First response: First of all, people don't eat gasoline. That's just a common misconception. And personally? I think we should just..let loose, you know? Drive our cars into the ozone layer. Eat garbage. Poop anywhere we want, like...the earth is fucked, and we're all going to be dead by the time global warming really takes effect, so, what's the point, right?<br /><br />Second response: I..I was talking pretty normally. I didn't...really don't think I did anything..like fast forwarding? That's..what the hell does that even mean?<br /><br />Third response: That's absurd. Not true at all. I don't..I'm talking [at a] very normal speed right now.<br /><br />",

What's that Jovi quote?<br /><br />Amir: I mean, I'm gonna tell you what it is because it's such a chill quote that it belongs with that screen name, but: She says we <br /><br />gotta hold on to what we got cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not. How could you do that? Like, you know I thought <br /><br />that was the chillest.<br /><br />Jake: What's Streeter's handle? I need to add him. I'm trying to flesh out this BL right now.<br /><br />Amir: I'm supposed to be the chill dude.<br /><br />Jake: Chill out, dude. All's fair in love and chill, you know that.<br /><br />",

Do you want me to..?<br /><br />Amir: The next......<br /><br />Jake: Am I supposed to finish that sentence for you?  <br /><br />Amir: Alright, first idea.

Okay. It would text you whenever anybody hits a homerun.  <br /><br />Amir: Facebook for college students.

I don't know what that meant. Any idea?<br /><br />Jake: Nope. It's your list. Just cross it off don't check it. There you go.  <br /><br />Amir: Funny chinese names.<br /><br />Jake: I mean, that's offensive and not a good idea.  <br /><br />Amir: Uh, an alphabetical database.<br /><br />Jake: Of what?<br /><br />Amir: Anything.<br /><br />Jake: Next.<br /><br />Amir: Okay.  <br /><br />Amir: Uh, IMDb but no actors.

I know you wanted me to use it to document what I do on a day-to-day basis, so I'm gonna do exactly that. This is my video letter to you. Usually, I start every day by going over to my best friend Jake's house, who lives right here. (Presses a button on a nearby apartment building to buzz Jake) He's expecting me.<br /><br />JAKE: (talking through the buzzer) Hello?<br /><br />AMIR: It's me!<br /><br />JAKE: What the hell are you doing here?<br /><br />AMIR: I know you wanted to see what I do on a day-to-day basis, so this is my video letter to you. Usually, I start every day by visiting my best friend Jake, who lives right here. (Buzzes Jake) He's expecting me.<br /><br />JAKE: (talking through the buzzer) Agh. Come on up.<br /><br />AMIR: See?<br /><br />(Amir knocks on Jake's apartment door. Jake opens it.)<br /><br />JAKE: You have twenty minutes.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, cut. Don't-<br /><br />(Amir, outside the apartment again, knocks shave and a haircut; Jake opens the door.)<br /><br />JAKE: Stay as long as you want.<br /><br />(AMIR knocks the first part of shave and a haircut; Jake opens, and does the two bits part vocally.)<br /><br />JAKE: Da da!<br /><br />(Amir enters, and turns the camera to a woman sitting on the couch)<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! Mara's here. (turns the camera to Jake) Kind of a third wheel, right?<br /><br />[Amir is facing the camera again]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake usually has food prepared for me when I get here. What's for brunch today, Jake? (Turns the camera to Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: Here you go. (Tosses a bag of buns to Amir)<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, come on. What is this?<br /><br />[Jake is preparing a bowl of cereal.]<br /><br />JAKE: Honey Nut Cheerios, your favorite.<br /><br />(Amir is sitting at the table, facing the camera)<br /><br />AMIR: Brunch was delicious! Now we usually see a movie. What's it today, partner-in-life?<br /><br />JAKE: Absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: Rush Hour 3?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on, man. Come on. (Puts the camera down) 20 bucks. 20 bucks for the movie.<br /><br />JAKE: 40.<br /><br />[Amir is facing the camera again]<br /><br />AMIR: Now we usually see a movie. What's it today, buddy?<br /><br />JAKE: It's Rush Hour 3.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow, Rush Hour 3. Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?<br /><br />JAKE: That's Rush Hour 1.<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are still at the table, the camera turned on Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: How was the movie, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: It was good.<br /><br />AMIR: What was your favorite part?<br /><br />JAKE: (unenthusiastically) The karate.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on.<br /><br />[Jake is in the bathroom talking to Mara, and Amir is surreptitiously filming them through the partially opened door.]<br /><br />AMIR: (to the camera) Mom, take a look. Jake and his girlfriend are in the bathroom together.<br /><br />Mara: I want him the FUCK out of here, Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, calm down! I'll tell him to leave right now.<br /><br />(Amir runs back to the kitchen.)<br /><br />AMIR: Um. Usually, we play videogames after the movie.<br /><br />[Amir is filming himself in the mirror, pretending to walk down nonexistent stairs; he notices Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: What's up man? Hey, uh, videogames.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, no. You gotta get out of here.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry, uh, you just gotta go.<br /><br />AMIR: What's up?<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing, it's just time to leave.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay.

Definitely.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />AMIR: Hold this. (He hands Jake the camera; sounds of him counting money can be heard.) Alright, fine. I only have 80 left, but...<br /><br />Mara: Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: See you later.<br /><br />AMIR: Come on, man! I'll give you 20...<br /><br />JAKE: There's an ATM around the corner.<br /><br />Mara: Jake!<br /><br />AMIR: I'll be--<br /><br />JAKE: Go, quick.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll be back in, like, less than two minutes. Where is it?<br /><br />JAKE: Around the corner. This is still taping.<br /><br />AMIR: Turn it off, I'll be back--<br /><br />[Amir is talking to the camera, still in Jake's apartment.]<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, time to go! Uh, hold this. One second. (Gives the camera to Mara.) Later man. (Hugs Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: See you later.<br /><br />AMIR: Bye mom!<br /><br />(THANKS MOM displays, with Thong Song by Sisqó playing)<br /><br />[Mara is still holding the camera, pointing it at Amir. Amir is waving at Jake, who is off-camera.]<br /><br />AMIR: 20 for... 20, one shot waving.<br /><br />(Jake comes over and starts waving at the camera with Amir, while Amir fishes out a 20 dollar bill.)<br /><br />(Jake and Amir wave at the camera for a bit.)<br /><br />AMIR: Thank you so much.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to edit?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. No. I'll just put it in a timeline, and you export it. It's super easy. (Takes the camera back) How do you turn it off?<br /><br />JAKE: Right there. Top.<br /><br />",

Division I Men's Bracket Opening Round Game vs. March 18th. Who ya got?<br /><br />JAKE: Let's start lower with an actual team. North Carolina vs. Mount St. Mary.<br /><br />AMIR: 16 - 1 already. So, once you're up 20, there's no going back. I'd be a fool to go for North Carolina in this situation. M T S T Mary, thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, you can't do math. Also, this isn't a scoreboard. These are their seeds.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. Not gonna change my pick.<br /><br />JAKE: You are though.

Okay, you can't (laughs) have them both, okay. So, I'll take Baylor and Perda over Zav-.

But, I have a feeling Mr. Hamilton (takes out $5 bill) will persuade the bracket masta.<br /><br />Jake takes $5 bill from Amir and throws it on the table.

I don't know, he's saying that everything is long. But, that's good, and it should be longer.

All the character names are Jake.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />DAN: You can't name the characters Jake-<br /><br />AMIR: Ok.<br /><br />DAN: Because people need to know-<br /><br />AMIR: We don't want to spoon-feed our audience.<br /><br />DAN: I don't know if I want to do this anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: I know.<br /><br />DAN: As a job.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, as a job.<br /><br />DAN: Will Ferrell, I doubt-<br /><br />AMIR: (deep voice) Frank the Tank!<br /><br />DAN: Is not gonna be in it because he's Will Ferrell.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well, the way I cast my characters is I- I- I aim for the moon and then I shoot myself.<br /><br />DAN: You just said you're gonna shoot yourself.<br /><br />AMIR: (scoffs) You're gonna let him talk to me like that.<br /><br />JAKE: Yep.<br /><br />AMIR: Ahh.<br /><br />DAN: So a couple more things.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, you know what, you haven't stopped bitching about this script since you got here.<br /><br />DAN: I'm trying to give you constructive criticism.<br /><br />AMIR: Hah, yeah. More like destructive cynicism.<br /><br />JAKE: How did you learn those words?<br /><br />DAN: Cool, so you know what? We got a good first line, we got a good last line, I'll just take it from there.<br /><br />JAKE: Just have one more crack at rewriting it.<br /><br />DAN: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Just give us one more-<br /><br />DAN: (simultaneously) No, don't worry guys.<br /><br />AMIR: (simultaneously) It's fine, we can do this. We're a dynamic team!<br /><br />DAN: You know what, no, because you know what, you don't even deserve an excuse, I'm just gonna write it, 'cause it's really bad!<br /><br />(Dan walks out)<br /><br />AMIR: Ok? Wow. What- what crawled into his butt? Jake. (high voice) Vhat crawled into his butthole? Hm. Jake. Give me his SMS code right now, I'm gonna text him that question.

So...<br /><br />JAKE: Did you know that if too much blood flows into it, his dick can actually explode?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm kidding. (Amir laughs) Got you!<br /><br />AMIR: (holds hammer) I wanna throw this hammer so that it hits right in between your eyes.<br /><br />JAKE: Ok, that's weird, because that's the opposite of what I want to happen.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, opposites attract, so, close your eyes.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't really make sense here.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't think I'm explaining it right.<br /><br />JAKE: No, you're explaining it fine.<br /><br />AMIR: It's not gonna hit your eyes (JAKE: I know) like either the left one or the right one, those are gonna be fine.<br /><br />JAKE: Just, yeah, in the middle, (AMIR: Yes.) I know. I get it. I just don't want it, I don't want it to hit any part of me at all.<br /><br />AMIR: I feel like I'm doing the hard part by throwing it, and then you're not doing anything back, you know, like you're not bringing anything.<br /><br />JAKE: Well, some people might say that I have to, I have the tough job of ex- trying to convince you not to throw it.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok. But you can't convince me not to do this, I'm so set. Like, I, it's already happened in my head.<br /><br />JAKE: Still, I could probably say something like- (two loud bangs) Oh. What happened?<br /><br />AMIR: Huh.<br /><br />JAKE: You Ok?<br /><br />AMIR: (strained) Yee.<br /><br />JAKE: Yee, you're Ok.<br /><br />AMIR: Yee.<br /><br />JAKE: Yee, Ok, what did you hurt?<br /><br />AMIR: (in pain) I didn't hurt anything, I'm juuuu-ah!<br /><br />JAKE: You're just...<br /><br />AMIR: I'm fine.<br /><br />JAKE: You're grunting.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm grunting because I, oh, my head hur- I have a headache.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh. Why does- Did you- Are you sure you didn't hit your hand with a hammer?<br /><br />AMIR: (touches head with bloody hand) No, it just- It feels super swollen, like right around here. Is it, like, real- It look- It feels like it's throbbing.<br /><br />JAKE: Your head doesn't, your head looks fine. Your hand, though, looks really bad.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, no, yeah, I just spilled it in lemonade.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I can see bone.<br /><br />AMIR: Raspberry lemonade.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't explain the bone.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, uh, ooh, I'm gonna pass out because I'm in a lot of pain.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: But I'm pretty positive you're not right. (puts head down)<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I dunno, I think I'm right, but it's a good idea. Why don't you take a nap, maybe we'll go to the hospital when we- (hammer flies past Jake)<br /><br />AMIR: (with head down) Jake, did it hit? Jake.<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

Like, I graduated college three years ago, and I find myself travelling a lot more, just--the difference between holding one of these luggages and rolling them? It's night and day. It's absolutely night and day. And these airports are so expansive! I mean, have you been to the new airport in Atlanta? Terminal A's on one side of the city, I feel like I need an airplane to get to the other side of the airport. I mean, it's just absolutely obscene. And--you know I'm a jogger. I mean, I like to jog. But the problem isn't the jogging, it's--it's stopping, right when I stop, I'm feeling this--this  tightness in my arch and in my toes. And, you know, I go to the orthopedic surgeon and he's telling me it's plain orphochitis and I want a second recommendation, it's just unbelievable what kind of--and I am blabbing so much about myself and I cannot believe how self-centered I've been. We should get some coffee one time this week. What are you doing on Thursday? I'm going to an opera or such, I don't know, some gay shit like that, it's just like a work in progress you know?

I'm just going to do it and you're going to owe me a buck. You're fine with straight owing me cash? ...OK, I did it.

So. <br /><br />VINNY: Uh, lighting. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes. <br /><br />AMIR: But what's--First question. What's the difference between thunder and lighting?<br /><br />JAKE: (softly) Sometimes we have to get to work as early as like 7AM to shoot, so a lot of us nap during the day to catch up on sleep. <br /><br />AMIR: Let's wake one of them up right now. (goes over to couch)<br /><br />JAKE: (softly) We're not going to do that.  No-No, no, no, no.  <br /><br />AMIR: Streeter, Streeter we want to interview--<br /><br />(Streeter gets up and pulls Amir to the floor, then begins strangling him)<br /><br />STREETER: Don't wake the f**king bear! <br /><br />JAKE: OK, hold on!

Ooo, Jeff Rubin, tell me what is it like--<br /><br />AMIR: N-n-no, you tell me what is it like ruining every single take you are in? Sucking the life out of an otherwise great experience from everyone else?<br /><br />JEFF: What-what are you guys--What is this? <br /><br />(back to Streeter on top of Amir strangling him)<br /><br />AMIR: You can cut. <br /><br />STREETER: You don't wake the bear!<br /><br />AMIR: You can cut.

Uh, yes. Umm, I-I guess when I walk into a lighting set up that's profound to me, it-it sometimes is--<br /><br />AMIR: I mean just like straight up a lighting bolt just (imitates getting struck by lightning)<br /><br />JAKE: He gave you an out and you didn't take it. <br /><br />AMIR: What? <br /><br />(back to Sarah)<br /><br />AMIR: I hate it when you look at me like I'm stupid. <br /><br />JAKE: I've never looked at you like you weren't stupid. <br /><br />(Just Jake and Sarah)<br /><br />JAKE: All right, Sarah. Who is your favorite person to be in scenes with?<br /><br />SARAH: Ooo--<br /><br />AMIR (off camera): Come on, let's go, Jake.<br /><br />JAKE: One second. <br /><br />AMIR: Let's go. <br /><br />SARAH: I'm trying to answer your question here. <br /><br />AMIR: We've already got another interview lined up with someone better. <br /><br />AMIR (still off camera): We can't use this. I'm telling you right now we're not going to use this.  <br /><br />SARAH: (to Jake) Why do you hang out with him all the time? <br /><br />JAKE: I don't hang out with him all the time. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes we do. <br /><br />(back to Vinny)<br /><br />AMIR: So basically you're just the guy that holds the camera, right? <br /><br />VINNY: Uh, not at all, I'm actually--<br /><br />JAKE: He does a lot more. <br /><br />VINNY: --I'm responsible for the visual--<br /><br />AMIR: Vinny Peone, a glorified human tripod.<br /><br />VINNY: I'm responsible for the visual story telling. <br /><br />JAKE: He's responsible for the vi--<br /><br />(Amir motions to camera to cut) <br /><br />THE END. <br /><br />http://www.collegehumor.com/video/3890459/jake-and-amir-behind-the-scenes-of-the-collegehumor-show-part-2<br /><br />",

All of a sudden, you're not making many steps, right? (JAKE: You step in) You have to always- So we're telling you, out-think the Chinese proverbs, because, (JAKE: That's.. vaguely racist, and I don't think we should--) yes, they're smart, but, we can be better than that. And it takes.. just one person, to make it--<br /><br />JAKE: You heard it from Amir: we can be better than the Chinese. Is that what you want to say?--<br /><br />AMIR: What? That's- When you say it like that it's mean, and that's not what I meant. We can be just as good as they are.<br /><br />JAKE: We are- Everybody's equal! That's..--<br /><br />AMIR: Not at math!<br /><br />(Amir waves at the camera.)<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, everybody, have a really fun and enriching weekend.--<br /><br />AMIR: And don't just use this weekend to hook up with other people (JAKE: That's f--); you're to young to kiss, anyway.<br /><br />JAKE: They're n-- How old were you when you kissed a girl?<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Freshman, in c- high school..

Anyway. Uh, tell us a little bit about the album. How long has it been, like, in the works.<br /><br />ANDY: Um, I mean... in a lot of ways, since the day we were born, right?<br /><br />JORM: Yeah.<br /><br />ANDY: I mean, some say destiny.<br /><br />KIV: In a more accurate way I would say, like, this summer.<br /><br />ANDY: Yeah, pretty m- this summer.<br /><br />KIV: (inaudible) ..this summer.<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, the Beatles, uh Beastie Boys, uh Busta Rhymes... what do these guys have in common? It's...<br /><br />JAKE: The \"B\".<br /><br />AMIR: ...four.<br /><br />JAKE: The--<br /><br />AMIR: The-- four. They all had four different people. You guys have three.<br /><br />ANDY: Mmhmm.<br /><br />AMIR: Which is close. Like, how do you guys envision getting to that next, the fourth person, and--<br /><br />KIV: Wait, the Beatles--<br /><br />AMIR: The Beatles,<br /><br />KIV: and Busta Rhymes,<br /><br />AMIR: The Busta Rhymes, and the Beastie Boys.<br /><br />KIV: and Beastie Boys all had four people?--<br /><br />ANDY: There's a band called \"the Busta Rhymes\"?<br /><br />AMIR: What would I need to do to throw my name into that mix, like what would you need to know about me?<br /><br />ANDY: Um, I mean you'd probably have to become very independently successful, right?<br /><br />AMIR: Sure.<br /><br />ANDY: Like in a Busta Rhymes kind of a way.<br /><br />AMIR: Like more than I already am?<br /><br />JAKE: There's three of you guys.<br /><br />JORM: That's true.<br /><br />JAKE: And uh, most of your songs have two--kind of--two people? So how do you decide which one of you guys are gonna pair up?<br /><br />JORM: Whoever leaves the room is not in the song.<br /><br />ANDY: Certainly can't go in vacation.--<br /><br />JAKE: (pointing to the floor) This room right here?<br /><br />ANDY: (looks up) Yup.<br /><br />JORM: No if you go on vacation then you get left and you don't get to go on a fuckin' boat ride.<br /><br />JAKE: Is that what happened?<br /><br />JORM: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Really?<br /><br />AMIR: You went on vacation?<br /><br />JORM: But I'm not upset about it.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm interested in freestyle rap battling one of you guys.

(speaking) So let's switch.<br /><br />(Amir and Jorm get up to switch places)<br /><br />AMIR: That was a bit out of beat.<br /><br />KIV: Yeah, it was really good.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok.<br /><br />ANDY: And we'll add me in post, right?<br /><br />JORM: You just went raw dog.<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping, Andy providing rap gestures) Yo, whatchu talkin about our jacket, MC, that's not how it is, that's not how it be,--<br /><br />ANDY: (rapping) Yeah Jorm!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah Jorm, you understand that you're sittin next to my.. old.. best friend--<br /><br />ANDY: No, you're Jorm.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok. Ahh shee--<br /><br />[Amir and Jorm have switched places back to how it was originally]<br /><br />ANDY: You know, when we first entered into this I thought it was just gonna be really casual, and then shit just got really heated.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />ANDY: It was like we were in the movie \"8 Mile\".<br /><br />JAKE: So one of my-- one of my favorite songs come from-- comes from \"Please Incredibad, Don't Hurt 'Em\".<br /><br />ANDY: Nice<br /><br />JAKE: Uh, was that an official album?<br /><br />ANDY and KIV: No<br /><br />JORM: No, it was not, no. It was more of a web- web--<br /><br />ANDY: We almost called \"Incredibad\" \"Please Incredibad, Don't Hurt 'Em\", but then we called ourselves \"The Lonely Island\", so we just called the album \"Incredibad\".<br /><br />JORM: And also han--<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping loudly) Five o'clock in the morning, I hear the phone ringing (points to Jorm)<br /><br />JORM: ...Yo wuddup Dunn.<br /><br />AMIR: Whaddup son, sorry boy you sleeping?<br /><br />ANDY: (referring to Kiv) He's not gonna--<br /><br />KIV: No..<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping) Just finished reading this ill-ass novel...<br /><br />JORM: (unenthusiastically) Not the one about the girl who left her family back in Kabul<br /><br />AMIR: (butting in) family up in-- A little louder. Cuz I dunno, like--<br /><br />JORM: The skill-set that you're bringing to the table is rap, right?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JORM: K I'm just.. ok.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, so.<br /><br />(Amir laughs)<br /><br />KIV: I mean, I can't speak for the group, but from my perspective you're in.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay.<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: So that's one. And then if I'm in that's two. So, it's like fifty-fifty at this point.<br /><br />ANDY: Right. So it's a tie.<br /><br />AMIR: Down the road, I join the group.<br /><br />JAKE: I wanna--.<br /><br />AMIR: Whatever, ok, that.. becomes a thing.<br /><br />ANDY: Right.<br /><br />AMIR: Let's say I start feuding with Jorm over here.<br /><br />ANDY: Right.<br /><br />KIV: Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: We start fighting, it's obviously, it's not gonna happen with me and Jorm. We kick Jorm out...<br /><br />ANDY: Right<br /><br />KIV: Sure<br /><br />AMIR: We're down to three again, which is fine...<br /><br />ANDY: We need a fourth.<br /><br />JAKE: You said we needed--.<br /><br />AMIR: We needed a fourth, but we realized four might have been too many, once I joined the group.<br /><br />KIV: We've learned our lesson, we're--.<br /><br />JAKE: Ok.<br /><br />AMIR: My question is, do we still need that fourth? And if so... (points to Jake) my guy right here.<br /><br />ANDY: Mmhmm.<br /><br />KIV: Hmm.<br /><br />ANDY: I have a-- I think we bring him on...<br /><br />AMIR: Ok<br /><br />ANDY: ...but then we also ditch me.<br /><br />AMIR: Sure.<br /><br />ANDY: So then it's you guys and Kiv.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok.<br /><br />KIV: I'd like that.<br /><br />ANDY: That sounds.. that'll be--<br /><br />JORM: That sounds like a group.<br /><br />[Jorm and Andy are in Jake and Amir's old spots, while Jake and Amir sit on the couch with Kiv.]<br /><br />ANDY: So, uh, what's next for you guys, what's next for the Lonely Island?<br /><br />AMIR: (looking at his watch) Oh my God, I am so so sorry we gotta wrap things up, right? Cuz we have-- we're getting like lots of people coming in and out all the time.<br /><br />JORM: That's understandable.<br /><br />ANDY: That's cool.<br /><br />(Jorm and Andy get up to shake Jake and Amir's hands)<br /><br />JORM: Hey, nice to meet you guys.<br /><br />ANDY: Hey thanks.<br /><br />JAKE: (shaking Andy's hand) Nice to meet you<br /><br />(Amir avoids shaking Jorm's hand by reaching over to pick up a piece of melon with the tongs, then puts it in his mouth)<br /><br />JORM: (walking out of the room with Andy) Ok, um, thanks guys.<br /><br />AMIR: (with the piece of melon in his mouth) Byebye.<br /><br />JORM: How do you get out? ok<br /><br />KIV: (to Amir) Assholes.<br /><br />AMIR: Huge dicks, right?<br /><br />END.",

But he has like this insanely good business idea which is why I invested my last $5,000 in it, and uh, it's going to make both of us rich. <br /><br />AMIR: Insanely good business idea? <br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, it's called scale.com. You step on your laptop and the site will actually weigh you.<br /><br />AMIR: OK. That's MY idea, BITCH!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm kidding! You think I would tell you the business idea? I don't even know it yet. <br /><br />AMIR: But you said it was insanely good?<br /><br />JAKE: It's called trusting someone. Your brother.<br /><br />AMIR: My brother? <br /><br />JAKE: My brother.<br /><br />AMIR: Your brother?<br /><br />JAKE: Shut up, all right? Nevermind. <br /><br />AMIR: Jake, I don't think Kumail is the trustworthy guy you think he is. <br /><br />JAKE: Why? Because I want to hang out with him more than I want to hang out with you?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, that. And yesterday when you were in the bathroom, he was like digging around, looking for pay stubs or whatever.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, so . . . <br /><br />JAKE: You've kept me from my own surprise party, you've spied on me in the bathroom, you poisoned my food, but this is a new low. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes, but have I ever lied to you?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, sure. You told me you had 60 beers once.  You said you never drop anything. You said you had some new girlfriend--<br /><br />AMIR: OK, shut up! <br /><br />JAKE: NO, YOU SHUT UP! My brother is finally back and I'm happy and he's going to make us both rich and for once I'm not going to let you f**k it up for me. <br /><br />AMIR: Frine!<br /><br />JAKE: Frine or fine?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, why don't you ask your brother. He seems to know everything!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? Maybe I will, because he's in the kitchen right now and we're going to get lunch together, bitch!<br /><br />AMIR: You're a bitch!  <br /><br />JAKE: You're a bitch.<br /><br />AMIR: You're the bitch. <br /><br />JAKE: You're a bitch's bitch. (beat) Nothing? <br /><br />AMIR: You're a ... bitch's bitch.<br /><br />(Kumail is in the kitchen with Sarah attempting to juggle) <br /><br />KUMAIL: You know, Jake said he worked with a bunch of 5's and 6's but you are a legit 7. <br /><br />SARAH: (chuckles apprehensively) Uh, thanks. <br /><br />KUMAIL: I probably see myself doing you if you know what I mean?<br /><br />SARAH: Wow, that's pretty clear--<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, Sarah!  Did you meet my brother, Kumail?<br /><br />SARAH: Yeah, just did. <br /><br />JAKE: Cool.<br /><br />KUMAIL: Lunch time?<br /><br />JAKE: Absolutely man, where to?<br /><br />KUMAIL: Wherever.

Also, does not know how to pronounce et cetera.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, I didn't say that, Jake.<br /><br />Jake: Thought you weren't talking to me.<br /><br />Amir: Ah!

It looks like a banana vagina, go back to your desk.<br /><br />(Amir sits at his desk)<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, babe. <br /><br />JAKE: Wow, don't make that a thing you call me.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow, you're not my MOM! So...dinner tonight?<br /><br />JAKE: You just yelled at me and now you want to ask me to din--<br /><br />AMIR: YOU JUST SHUT the f-f-front door...sorry. Dinner tonight?<br /><br />JAKE: Even if you weren't yelling at me, I have dinner plans already. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, just tell me which McDonald's we're going to and keep in mind that three of them won't have me back so to speak, and you know that! <br /><br />JAKE: Not going to McDonald's, all right? I'm going to another restaurant called Nina's. <br /><br />AMIR: Oh, I've been there.  That's that place where they have that thing where if you cuss at your waitresses you get free drinks. <br /><br />JAKE: No, it's not. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes it is. <br /><br />JAKE: So you've done that? <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I mean, it's not like this special deal that they advertise, it's like this special audio coupon that you can cash in. I'm surprised you didn't know that.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm surprised you think it's a coupon. <br /><br />AMIR: I mean, it's not like this physical coupon or whatever. It's like the same thing about like when you go to a restaurant and you order something that they don't have on the menu but they'll still give it to you, if you openly weep and you like throw a fit. <br /><br />JAKE: Like a temper tantrum?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, like a tempa-tension. <br /><br />JAKE: Not what I said. So, do you do this often?<br /><br />AMIR: No, you can't do it often! You can only do it once at every restaurant in the city. I mean, do you really not know that? <br /><br />JAKE: I guess I just feel bad cashing in these types of coupons. <br /><br />AMIR: Nah, don't feel bad. I mean, these ones are tame compared to the ones my cousin Leron cashes in.  (laughs) He cashed in this one coupon -- <br /><br />JAKE (over Amir): Don't keep going with this story, because I don't want to be implicated and I don't want to hear about what you and your weird cousin do in your free time. It really freaks me out! It freaks everybody else out, all right? Dude, just shut up!! <br /><br />AMIR (getting louder as Jake is talking): once where he took hold of this waitress and he just basically, he pushed her in the back and he shoved her against the table and she's like 'Ah, my god!' (incoherent) and just Jake, I'd do it a lot more, OK...<br /><br />(Amir continues after Jake stops)<br /><br />AMIR: I'd do it a lot more, if I wasn't so afraid of smelling, tasting, seeing waitress blood and stuff like that.<br /><br />JAKE: OK, now I've lost my appetite. <br /><br />AMIR: Sorry about that, babe.<br /><br />THE END.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g46_qkAPNNA<br /><br />",

How much though?<br /><br />JAKE: Try three bottles of vodka!  <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! I knew that! I could drink more than that. <br /><br />JAKE: I know you can because you had some fucking gin right afterwards!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh yeah, we had the gymnastics.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, they called you the gin guzzler, yo. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, they call me the gym guzzler, yo. <br /><br />JAKE: The gin guzzler.

How do you not remember this? <br /><br />AMIR: I do, uh, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: You were fucking cussing her out.

No, no, no.<br /><br />JAKE: Then, he flails you up against the wall--<br /><br />(Amir throws himself against the wall)<br /><br />JAKE: --and he's like 'I'm going to kick your ass' and you're fucking pleading with your eyes--<br /><br />(Amir is making a puppy face)<br /><br />JAKE: --please don't take my life, please don't take my life.

Please, please, please.' Then I lent you ten bucks and I want that back now and I won't tell anybody about what happened last night. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, I only have a twenty.

But everything was all backwards so it was difficult to read. <br /><br />JAKE: I mean, there's a f***ing arrow.<br /><br />AMIR: I know,  I thought it was a letter.<br /><br />JAKE: Then you didn't know. You either knew, or you thought it was a letter. <br /><br />AMIR: Then I thought it was a letter. <br /><br />JAKE: OK, I know. Look, even if by some small miracle everybody in this office gave a s**t that it was your half birthday and they wanted to clap for you so loudly that you could even *ask* them to stop, if you needed to display a message on your chest, wouldn't you feel weird about admitting that you knew all of this all along? <br /><br />AMIR: I'm going to f***ing kill Leron if there's an arrow on my back, I swear. <br /><br />THE END. <br /><br />OUTRO<br /><br />AMIR: He's done, simple as that.

Maybe it shouldn't be a Jack, it should be a black, like a gangster.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, that's actually racist.<br /><br />Amir: Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.<br /><br />Jake: Right.

The cards are flat on the table so Jake can show Amir how to play.<br /><br />Jake: You have fifteen with the dealer showing ten. That would mean you want to hit.<br /><br />Amir raises his right arm and tries to slap Jake again, but this time Jake blocks Amir's hand with his arm and slams it on the table.<br /><br />Jake: Not me.<br /><br />Amir looks like he's in pain but moves his hand.<br /><br />Jake: I'm sorry.<br /><br />Amir: Nah, don't be. I messed up and you deserve to hit me.<br /><br />Jake: Okay<br /><br />Amir: I was kidding!<br /><br />Jake: Okay, you have a ten and a seven. How much is that worth?<br /><br />Amir: Thirty-one. Er! Twenty-one.<br /><br />Jake: No, seventeen.<br /><br />Amir: No. Yeah, seventeen. I thought you multiply them together or something.<br /><br />Jake: Would still be wrong.<br /><br />Amir: [annoyed] Ah!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: Still be right. Okay, I think I'm ready to go downstairs and play.<br /><br />Jake: How many cards are dealt?<br /><br />Amir: Uh, Queen.<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, just keep teaching me and stop being a dick about it? [flips the top card in the deck over]<br /><br />Amir is now holding the deck of cards in his hand.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, maybe we should learn how to count cards. [flips a card] One, [flips another card] two, [flips another card] Aahh! Um, okay, let's go back to basic strategy.<br /><br />Jake: That's a basic strategy. [Takes deck of cards from Amir]<br /><br />Amir: Yeah. <br /><br />Amir has the deck of cards. Jake is looking away from him with his arms on the table. He is exhausted and pissed off. Amir pulls a card from the deck and holds it up to Jake.<br /><br />Amir: Was this your card?<br /><br />Jake: They're all my cards. You made me pick every card. [Finally looks at card]<br /><br />Amir: [Looks at card] Just a yes or no, and then we'll move forward.<br /><br />Jake: Yes.<br /><br />Amir picks another card from the deck and shows it to Jake. Cut to Amir holding the deck in his left hand.<br /><br />Amir: And that's why they call me [hold up half to deck to Jake] the King of clubs.<br /><br />Jake: That's the seven of diamonds.<br /><br />Amir: I'm that - yes, I'm that too.<br /><br />Jake: You're a seven of diamonds?<br /><br />Cut to Amir jumping up and down on his bed. Jake is looking away again. The deck of cards has been abandoned on the table.<br /><br />Jake: You know I don't have to teach you anymore if you don't want.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, okay, just give me just five more minutes! T-bag.<br /><br />Amir jumps onto Jakes bed while Jake looks at him surprised.<br /><br />Jake: You know what? Let's play this instead. [Hold up deck] If it's red, say fire. If it's black, say smoke.<br /><br />Amir: Smoke.<br /><br />Jake puts that card down to reveal the next card.<br /><br />Amir: Fire.<br /><br />Jake shoots the deck at Amir and the cards fly into his face. Amir squeezes his eyes shut, then looks sadly at the disorganized cards. Jake smiles.<br /><br />Jake: Come on, it's funny.<br /><br />Amir still looks upset.<br /><br />Cut to Jake knocking on the bathroom door. He looks full of regret.<br /><br />Jake: Amir, are you there? I'm really sorry.<br /><br />Amir: [opens the door from the inside] I'm really sorry! Sorry for ever trusting you!

You—<br /><br />Amir: I'm not afraid of little poker players, okay? Relax.<br /><br />[Shot cuts to Jake waiting for Amir, when he arrives appearing disheveled.]<br /><br />Amir: (giggles) Got my wallet.<br /><br />Jake: Oh my god.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, it's an n-big-d.

I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever. Oh sheesh y'all.<br /><br />",

Easy money.<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />[Jake and Amir sitting at their desks]<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa, Jake, I just realized something big. The sky is blue because of.. the scattering like, sunlight fragmi--mints, and then, a prism, and, your human eyes.<br /><br />JAKE: That was smart. Even though you kinda went off into sentence fragments at the end there and made no coherent point, I think you're smart because you used big words. And then when you finished, you raised your eyebrows at me, which really solidified the point that you knew exactly what you were talking about.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, o- I mean on a sunny day, reighley scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, dark in the zenith and light near the.. horizon!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow. It sounded a lot like you were reading from Wikipedia, but I know for a fact that you couldn't have been because you were raising your eyes to look at me every few seconds to prove that you were speaking your own original thoughts.<br /><br />AMIR: Absolowly.<br /><br />JAKE: You mean absolutely.<br /><br />AMIR: (stumbling as he makes up a definition) No, uh, I mean absolowly, which is.. Franish for.. absolutely.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, ok. At first I thought you misspoke, but the way you spun it around on me, and me realize that I was wrong, makes you look smart, and me look stupider by comparison. (Amir makes a variety of strange faces). Especially because I didn't even know Franish was a language, but I know that it must be, because you said it with such conviction and confidence. Even now as I talk, you're just nodding your head, which makes me realize that you knew you were right all along--<br /><br />AMIR: (rapping) Yo yo SO, son, I wanna jump around and make ya go.... AAAH! (Amir's aaah noise)<br /><br />JAKE: That was a tight rap. (Amir continues making strange faces.) Normally raps have to rhyme, but you delivered it in such a way that made you seem like a professional freestyler. You know, even when you seemingly couldn't think of the next word you kind of just went aaah and shook your head, which made me realize that you were purposefully done talking. As a result, I'm your good friend now and I want to hang out more, take you to McDonald's and just generally hang you with you as much as possible.<br /><br />(Amir pumps his arms up and down with his palms upward.)<br /><br />JAKE: Now you're raising the roof, which I thought was outdated, but I know that it can't be outdated because you're doing it. I've grown to respect you so much in the last few minutes. I'm realizing you're not getting my sarcasm, even though I'm laying it on very thick.<br /><br />(Amiir squints and nods.)<br /><br />JAKE: Now you're squinting and nodding because you know you should be comprehending something, but you're still not.<br /><br />(Amir smiles.)<br /><br />JAKE: And now you're smiling because you think that I think that you understand--<br /><br />AMIR: (childishly impatient and exasperated) Are we gonna go the the Dees or not?!<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

Amir has a sling on his right arm and 2 black eyes. He isn't wearing his glasses.<br /><br />Amir: So the nurse is like [closes nose] Sorry sir, we can't stay the night with you, even if you are afraid of the dark, [releases nose] and I'm like Bitch, you ain't going anywhere, there might be ghosts up in here so I grab her [grabs Jake's polo shirt] like-<br /><br />Jake: Hey, hey, hey, you don't have to tell me anything you might be embarrassed about.<br /><br />Amir: I'm not embarrassed about anything! So I grab her right [grabs Jake again] and she finally wrestles loose and she goes to call, I don't know, her supervisor or whatever [begins to rustle through Sarah's bag] but it's complete darkness in there so I start freaking out.<br /><br />Jake sees Amir going through Sarah's bag<br /><br />Jake: [Whispers angrily] Hey, hey, get your hand out of Sarah's bag OK? She is right there.<br /><br />Pan over to Sarah who is sitting at her desk wearing headphones and facing her computer. Pan back to Amir who continues going through the bag.<br /><br />Amir: [chuckles] What do I care? So you know it's complete darkness in there, I'm crying but it's starting to burn because [in a weird voice] my eyes are broken or whatever-<br /><br />Jake: Stay out of Sarah's bag<br /><br />At this moment Amir pulls a pink tampon out of Sarah's bag. He puts his hands up as if he were surrendering without noticing the tampon in his hand.<br /><br />Amir: OK, relax. [looks at tampon] Oh...<br /><br />Jake closes his eyes then massages his forehead.<br /><br />Jake: [Looks away] Put that away. Put that away. Put that away.<br /><br />Amir unwraps the tampon and smells it.<br /><br />Jake: Amir don't. [Massages forehead again] Do you know what that is? Do you know what it is?<br /><br />At this point Amir holds the tampon is his mouth. He is moving it around inside his mouth while moaning.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, oh, ahaha!<br /><br />Jake: Sarah! Hey, Sarah.<br /><br />The camera pans to Sarah again who turns around and sees Amir with the tampon in his mouth. <br /><br />Amir is now making gargling noises. <br /><br />Amir appears to be stuffing the tampon down his throat. <br /><br />The camera cuts to Jake with a confused look on his face.<br /><br />The camera cuts back to Amir who has closed his mouth on the tampon. The string at the end sticks out of his mouth.<br /><br />The camera cuts to Sarah who looks at Amir with disgust.<br /><br />The camera cuts back to Amir. (It is implied that) the tampon is completely inside his mouth now. He swallows. His face which was smiling before, now looks concerned and scared.<br /><br />Jake: Wow, are you ok?<br /><br />Amir: [speaks in wheezes] I'm fine.<br /><br />Jake: Good, so you're not choking or anything?<br /><br />Amir: [speaks in wheezes] Choking? Haha, don't make me laugh. [Laughs]<br /><br />Jake: [in unison with Amir's laugh, but with concern] Hahahahahaha, so you don't need the Heimlich?<br /><br />Amir: [still wheezing] Heimlich, what are you crazy? I'm gonna go get lunch [Jake nods], um, do you want anything?<br /><br />Jake: [Shakes his head] Nope. I don't.<br /><br />Amir: [wheezing] I'm going to peace on outta here [makes peace sign with his hands]<br /><br />Jake: Alright, peace out.<br /><br />Amir begins to wheel himself away, pushing Jake's chair in the process. Amir seems to be calm while Jake is still freaking out.<br /><br />Amir: But, oh, by the way, before I forget, [takes deep breath in] what's the name of that song that goes [starts dancing in his chair. Jake does the same, calmer now] Come my lady/come come my lady/you're my butterfly.<br /><br />At the same time:<br /><br />Jake: Sugar-<br /><br />Amir: [grabs Jake's shirt] I'M GONNA DIE!<br /><br />Jake quickly gets up while Amir wheezes and struggles to breathe. Jake goes around Amir and begins doing the modified Heimlich maneuver because Amir is in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Cut to Sarah who looks extra concerned.<br /><br />Cut back to Jake and Amir. Jake continues to do the Heimlich maneuver until the tampon falls out of Amir's mouth. Amir begins to struggle and cough. The tampon falls to the floor. Amir begins to breathe forcefully, still a little wheezing.<br /><br />Cut back to Sarah, who is still concerned.<br /><br />Jake: [relieved] God, that was close.<br /><br />Jake pats Amir on the back and ANOTHER tampon falls out of his mouth, then onto the floor. Jake and Sarah exchange confused looks.<br /><br />Amir: By the way it's Sugar Ray's Butterfly is the song.<br /><br />Jake: [shakes his head] That's not true.<br /><br />Amir: Yea, I know it's not.<br /><br />",

Sorry to interrupt. Uh, I bought a bag of cookies from the vending machine but it gave me an extra one. Do you guys <br /><br />want these cookies at all?<br /><br />jake: Yeah. Of course!<br /><br />Dan: Yeah.<br /><br />Sarah: Obviously.<br /><br />Vinny: Yeah. Of course! I love cookies.<br /><br />(Amir gives them the cookies; they start eating them and ignoring him while he tries to get them to pay him)<br /><br />Amir: It's like, uh... It's like eighty cents, it's so stupid. It was like eighty—eighty cents, so whenever you guys... And you guys <br /><br />are four people, so it'd be like, 20 cents or something. Twenty cents a pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Twenty! Twenty! Twenty! Twenty! <br /><br />There's no time limit. Ah that's funny! Throw a dime—throw two dimes into my mouth, each. Throw two dimes, go uh! uh!

It's less than a dollar. Twenty cents a pop! Twenty cents a pop!<br /><br />Jake: No. I have, like, a twenty dollar bill right now and that's it, so I can't give you twenty cents.<br /><br />Amir: Oh no! A twenty dollar bill? That's less than twenty cents! OH WAIT NO IT'S NOT!<br /><br />Sarah: We'll get it to you later, okay?<br /><br />Amir: I know, exactly, you'll get it to me later! You'll get it to me later!

I don't want your money, I just want your change! Eighty cents specifically! (Takes <br /><br />off the shirt) I'm just kidding you guys, it's me. And for this free show, a fare of twenty cents a head. Twenty, forty, the one after <br /><br />that, and finally landing on the eighty cents.<br /><br />Dan: I have a dollar. So let's just not do this anymore.<br /><br />Vinny: No, you should not...<br /><br />Amir: Thank you very much, [indiscernible] Martin Luther King Jr.—<br /><br />Jake: He doesn't have—you don't have to give him a dollar. You don't need a dollar. You payed for one bag, right? Two came out, you ate <br /><br />one, you gave us one. Why do you need a dollar? This is—it's twenty cents more than you paid.<br /><br />Amir: You know what? You're right. Okay, I only need eighty cents, and this a dollar, so here we go. (Tears a fifth of the bill off and <br /><br />gives it to Dan) Thank you, keep the change.<br /><br />(Pat comes in)<br /><br />Pat: Hey guys, um, sorry to interrupt. Has anyone seen a bag of cookies? By any chance?<br /><br />Amir: Uh, no, not here, dude. Sorry about that Pat.<br /><br />Pat: No?

I don't want to be near you. I don't want to be near Amir, not in work, not outside of work. I want some time apart. Which is sad for me to have to say because it sounds like we're going out or something.

I just had surgery on this shoulder this morning!<br /><br />JAKE: This morning?! God, I had no-- wow, I really had no idea. Look, can we just go, can we just go to Miami, sir? <br /><br />RICKY: Just get the hell out of my office. <br /><br />JAKE: Can we go? <br /><br />RICKY: Yeah. <br /><br />JAKE: Aww, sick son (high pitched) Motorola is sending us to Miami!<br /><br />AMIR: Let's get lunch right now and talk about--<br /><br />JAKE: Whoa, no.

That's kind of cool, so it's like campus Greeks versus ancient Greeks.<br /><br />AMIR: No, mine takes place in Rome and that's completely non-negotiable. So. <br /><br />AMIR: Wow.

I figured out a way to save time.<br /><br />Jake: By not talking during work?<br /><br />Amir: By wiping before you shit?<br /><br />Jake: How does that save you any time?<br /><br />Amir: How does what save you any time?<br /><br />Jake: [Jake takes a deep breath] I made a promise to myself that I wasn't going to get mad at you anymore, because it only stresses me out and it seems to have no effect on you. So...<br /><br />Amir: [Louder] How does what save you any time, though? How does what, [pause] save you any time, that is.<br /><br />Jake: How does wiping before you shit save you any time?<br /><br />Amir: It does.<br /><br />Jake: I would like to know how.<br /><br />Amir: And I'm telling you that it is, a time saver.<br /><br />Jake: I believe you that you believe it's a time saver.<br /><br />Amir: And I believe you, that you believe me, that is, because it is.<br /><br />Jake: Ok, but just tell me how it saves time.<br /><br />Amir: Ya just do it! You wipe, and then you shit.<br /><br />Jake: You're just explaining that you do it.

AHH!<br /><br />Jake: We don't have to agree on everything and that's fine.<br /><br />Amir: [Laughing] It is fine, because it does.<br /><br />Jake: You are wrong sometimes.<br /><br />Amir: I am never wrong sometimes.<br /><br />Jake: Because this doesn't change the two things that you have to do which is shit and wipe. It just switches the order. Maybe if you didn't wipe at all, but...<br /><br />Amir: Yes but if you switch the order it makes it so time is saved so, ahh! [laughs]<br /><br />Jake: You don't switch the order of things and save time.<br /><br />Amir: [laughs] Yes I do.<br /><br />Jake: But, OK.<br /><br />Amir: Ok<br /><br />Jake: Ok<br /><br />Amir: It is Ok because it does save time.<br /><br />Jake: It doesn't save time.<br /><br />Amir: [Singing and pretending to play an instrument] It is ok because it does save time, It is ok because it does save time.<br /><br />Jake: [Joins in the song] Boop boop bedoop, It doesn't save time.<br /><br />Amir: [Still singing and playing] Yes it does, Yes it does.<br /><br />Jake: [Stops singing] Well, whatever. That's a bad song anyway. Ok.<br /><br />Amir: [Still singing] Yes it does it does save time, yes it does it does save time.

All I'm saying is that if you wipe before you shit there's not a lot of shit there so you don't have to wipe as much! That's it! It's a time saver!<br /><br />Jake: That's it? <br /><br />Amir: That's it, yeah.<br /><br />Jake: That's really unsanitary. But I can see how you might say that's a time saver.<br /><br />Amir: Because it saves time.<br /><br />Jake: It still doesn't make any sense but, I can see your logic.<br /><br />Amir: [nodding] What doesn't make sense?<br /><br />Jake: I'll kill you.<br /><br />Amir: GAHHH<br /><br />",

This is a rough draft. <br /><br />Amir (still laughing): Still. Rigatoni? <br /><br />Jake: It's a pasta she used to make. <br /><br />Amir: Really? <br /><br />Jake: Spaghetti, but that doesn't start with an R, alright? <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, that's close enough. I'm sure she'd appreciate that. <br /><br />[Jump cut] <br /><br />Jake: R is for raising me. A gift that you continued to give me throughout my childhood. A is for arms- <br /><br />Amir: Again. <br /><br />Jake: Yup. <br /><br />Amir: Arms again... <br /><br />Jake: She has two, right? Does she have two arms? How many arms does she have? <br /><br />Amir: I think she has two, but- <br /><br />Jake: Okay. <br /><br />(Jake and Amir banter and mumble to each other) <br /><br />Amir: Go for it then. <br /><br />Jake: I am gonna go for it. <br /><br />Amir: Because it's gonna be good when you say it twice. <br /><br />Jake: I will. <br /><br />(more banter) <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I'm sure she loves you whether you say arms twice. <br /><br />[Jump cut] <br /><br />Jake: A is for appreciation, which I owe you eternally. Happy mother's day. <br /><br />Amir: Jake also got you a gift card for $100 to a spa. <br /><br />Jake: I didn't do that, so don't- <br /><br />Amir (Shows Jake a gift certificate): Yes, you did. <br /><br />Jake (grabbing the card from Amir): I did! Yes I did. Alright, love you mom. <br /><br />(Jake turns off the recording) <br /><br />Amir: So... <br /><br />Jake: This is great. Thanks, man. <br /><br />Amir: No probs. <br /><br />Jake: What did you get your mom? <br /><br />Amir: I didn't get her anything, because mother's day is a Hallmark holiday. So... <br /><br />Jake: Wow... Didn't you say it's also her birthday? <br /><br />Amir: It is also her birthday, yes. <br /><br />Jake: Okay... <br /><br />Amir: Two Hallmark holidays for the price of one. Free! (laughs) <br /><br />Jake: 'Cause why expend shit?<br /><br />Amir: 'Cause I ain't spendin' anythin'! (tries to take the card away from Jake) Can I get that card back, actually, because it's also her anniversary- <br /><br />Jake: Okay, no. Because you already gave it to me. <br /><br />Amir: Well it already expired!<br /><br />",

No news is good new though.<br /><br />JAKE: Well there is news and its bad news.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah that's why... It proves my point.<br /><br />JAKE: I hate when you're accidentally right. <br /><br />JAKE: Basically there was an accident and there is a well pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean every single day.<br /><br />AMIR: What's the big deal, just stuff it with garbage, that's what I would do.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow they actually thought of that and it's insanely disappointing that you're coming up with the same solutions as they are.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah... disappointing for me? Err...<br /><br />JAKE: For the world.<br /><br />AMIR: For the wolf.<br /><br />JAKE: For the world.<br /><br />AMIR: I think the scariest thing isn't the rate at which the oil is spilling but rather spiders!

I'm just KIDDING you idiot! Haha you Carfucker I got you! Yeah how about an automobile that runs on ocean water so that when the ocean water spills into the ocean nobody gives a crap? How about...<br /><br />AMIR: You know this whole thing wouldn't be an issue if oil was more dense than water, like I suggested!<br /><br />AMIR: Ah no no no kay kay kay, here we go. How about an automobile that's run on stupid ideas so we can just hook a pump to your ass and you can fart out these shitty ill-conceived notions for the rest of time and we can just power every car in America for the next thirty years.

Yeah...<br /><br />Jake: (mocking Amir) It's not a toy; it's a 3D puzzle game, meah MEAH! You know what you sound like, man? Heh... Show me how to solve it.<br /><br />Amir: Show you?<br /><br />Jake: Just show me how to solve it.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, teach you how to solve the cube?<br /><br />Jake: No, no, no, what could you possibly teach me?<br /><br />Amir: Uh... how to.. solve it.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, well then why aren't you doing it?<br /><br />Amir: Um... I will. Okay, so basically, it's simple. The first step is—<br /><br />Jake: Amir, Amir, I know it's simple. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do it. [Jake smooches.]<br /><br />Amir: Right. I guess so. Uh, you don't know how to do it, though, so...<br /><br />Jake: Why don't you teach me how to do it; then I'll show you how well I can do it, a LOT weller than you could ever do it.<br /><br />Amir: Weller. Okay, uh, so the first step is to do the entire front face the same, so right now—<br /><br />Jake: And then all the other steps are getting all of the other blocks the same, right? Why don't you not tell me WHAT to do, but tell me HOW to do it? How! Now!<br /><br />Amir: Okay (said as Oh-kay)... uh, yeah. So, well, then it's not called blocks; it's called cubes.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, cool. You're gonna treat me like a baby, then I'mma leave.<br /><br />[Jake gets up halfway and pauses.]<br /><br />Jake: And you're not even gonna try to stop me. WOW, you're the worst teacher ever, and yet I'm still able to learn from you. ...And I will master the art.<br /><br />Amir: Uh... right, so, uh, there are algorithms in play, so you wanna—<br /><br />Jake: I know what algorithms are.<br /><br />Amir: I didn't say you didn't know what algorithms were.<br /><br />Jake: Well, what are they?<br /><br />Amir: Um, they're ways to move the cube so that you don't mess up what you already have, so right now—<br /><br />Jake: I was the first kid in my grade to be able to solve one of these actually, y'know that? And then, I was like, Oh, there's a lot more important things to worry about, like getting laid! So I became the master of that.<br /><br />Amir: ...Right. So this one's called Right Inverted, Down Inverted, Right, Down.<br /><br />Jake: I'm gonna beat you right down, if you don't slow down, right now, okay? All of that went right over my head.<br /><br />Amir: Right, well, we're getting close, so just pay attention.<br /><br />Jake: How random would it be if I just punched you in the head right now?<br /><br />[Jake starts raising his fist repeatedly.]<br /><br />Jake: Right, directly, in the skull. Knocked out your lights.<br /><br />Amir: Whoa.<br /><br />Jake: Scared? Scared? Who has the upper hand? 'Cause you know what, kid? There are book smarts, and there are street smarts. And I got both; you got neith—<br /><br />Amir: Done! Hehe.<br /><br />[Amir hands Jake the Rubik's Cube, gets up, and leaves out the door.]<br /><br />Jake: Wow, that took you, like, four hours. Congratulations, that was amazing. The—the slowest solving of the Rubik's Cube ever!<br /><br />[Jake gets up and moves to the door.]<br /><br />Jake: Wow, check it out! I got—yo, I solved the cube! Everybody!<br /><br />[Jake tries to turn the door knob.]<br /><br />Jake: Very funny; who locked the door?<br /><br />[Jake is still locked in the room.]<br /><br />Jake: I might run out of air in here!<br /><br />[Jake takes out his phone.]<br /><br />Jake: (high-pitched voice) Oh no! I'm gonna die! (normal voice)  No, I'm not, 'cause I have a cell phone, and I'll text someone to come let me out!<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

Did you get the letter I sent you, babe?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't. Did you send me a letter?<br /><br />AMIR: I did. I did send you a letter, and let me know when you get it because there's a couple things that I want to clarify.  Firstly, in the opening paragraph--<br /><br />JAKE: I said I didn't get the letter.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, just let me know when you do because I left some things intentionally ambiguous. <br /><br />JAKE: Why would you intentionally leave things ambiguous?<br /><br />AMIR: So that I could clarify them later. Oooh!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, well I'll let you know.  <br /><br />AMIR: Please do. Please do-do. (chuckles) Please do-do, but not in my tea, or in my coffee! Haha, no. <br /><br />JAKE: Where'd you send it? Where'd you send the letter? What name and address did you put on it?  Cool, so I'm not going to get the letter. <br /><br />AMIR: Oh. You'll get the letter.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not going to get the letter, not if you didn't put a name and address on the envelope. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, I don't want to argue with you anymore about this stupid letter!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, you shouldn't.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, you're going to get it, and we're going to laugh. And we're going to laugh and we're going to crack up when you read it. <br /><br />JAKE: Even if I did get the letter--<br /><br />AMIR: Which you will.<br /><br />JAKE: --I don't think I'd laugh about it. I definitely wouldn't crack up. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, forget it. I'm going to change the subject. (pause) What do you think is in the letter?<br /><br />JAKE: How is that changing the subject?<br /><br />AMIR: (rapidly) Because before we were talking about whether or not you would get it and now we're talking about the contents of the letter. <br /><br />JAKE: Still sounds like we're talking about the letter. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well I'm not going to not talk about the letter, I want to talk about the letter!<br /><br />JAKE: OK, you know what? I got the letter.  I got the letter and it's at home and I'll read it and we'll talk about it tomorrow. <br /><br />AMIR: You didn't get the letter.<br /><br />JAKE: How do you know that?<br /><br />AMIR: Because I never sent a letter!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my god!<br /><br />AMIR: You placate me too often.  I address that in the letter.  (pause) Somewhat ambiguously, but I would clarify it later.

The only problem is I don't know who to talk to because—<br /><br />Amir: Because you don't know who my boss is, right? Cause you don't know what my job is. Sounds like you're S.O.L. (laughs)<br /><br />Jake: Maybe I'll just talk to Ricky.<br /><br />Amir: Wait don't! Okay.

But that is nay the point of this meeseege. The following is a note to my future self: firstly, don't tell Jake you got lost. Tell him you were at an Oscar after party, he'll think you're connected and cool. If he asks where the party is, spin another golden lie out of NOTHING. Shit, you forgot socks this morning, you idiot. This, coupled with the fact that you already forgot your shoes is gonna make you look like a real DUMBWAD. Okay, if Jake makes fun of you, just try and kick Pat in the face. Oh!

No problem son, a lot of adults wear diapers to sleep, not a peep, tell no one about your liquidatious...<br /><br />Amir: And then... you couldn't think of anything to rhyme with liquidatious, okay. Oh! One last thing, grocery list okay. Buy adult diapers.<br /><br />Jake picks up the phone.<br /><br />Jake: Yo!<br /><br />Amir: Oh, hey. Jake?

Can you delete some of the things you posted on his wall?<br /><br />Amir: What's- what things-what's some things?<br /><br />Jake: Sorry, that wasn't a question. Delete everything you've ever posted on his wall before.<br /><br />Amir: Uh, he's nineteen years old dude. Cut the cord. <br /><br />Jake: He's seventeen.<br /><br />Amir: Dude lied to me then. <br /><br />Jake: Did he lie to you or did you maybe just read his birthday wrong on his page?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah maybe that's it. <br /><br />Jake: That's it. Some of these things are like offensive and others are just annoying.<br /><br />Amir: Give me one example of each.<br /><br />Jake: Here's an example of both. 'Hey did you get my poke? Poke me back if you got it, playa. Hey, my last poke said poke me back if you got it, playa. But, everybody has poke so I'm expecting one unless you're a faggot.'<br /><br />Amir shrugs. <br /><br />Jake: What is that?<br /><br />Amir: A poke, it's like 'Hey, I got your attention but I don't have to write on your wall about it, just a way of saying...'<br /><br />Jake: Delete your Facebook.<br /><br />Amir: (clicks) Done.<br /><br />Jake: You didn't do anything. You just signed his wall again 'Hey, your big bro is acting like a toolbox extraordinary. Don't get mad if I piss on his jeans tonight.'<br /><br />Amir: A lot of these are just inside jokes between us so, butt it out. <br /><br />Jake: Well I just clicked on your wall to wall and he hasn't signed yours once and you leave him like videos like this. (Jake plays video) \"Micah, it's Amir. It's two am on a Wednesday. Poke that bitch or we're done! (laughs) Nah, no that was a joke but this is very serious. Call me right now. Your brother's hurt.\"<br /><br />Amir: Are you still pissed about the last time he visited?<br /><br />Jake: You mean when he went to get a drink from the water fountain and you shoved his face into it? Yeah, he lost two of his front teeth. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, I apologized for that.<br /><br />Jake: You said: 'Sorry you don't have a sense of humor, bitch.' <br /><br />Amir: And I genuinely meant that. Okay, I am sorry. I feel really badly that he doesn't have a sense of humor. Wh- What can I do? I can't go back and give him a sense of humor. It is what it is. I apologized.<br /><br />Jake: Just leave him alone, okay?<br /><br />Amir: Fine. (leaning into computer) Hey Micah, it's me...<br /><br />Jake: Are you leaving him a video message right now?<br /><br />Amir: Your brother's being a real toolbox extraordinary but poke me or I'll fucking kill you. <br /><br />",

What is all that?<br /><br />Amir: Can I interest the gentleman in, like, an English muffin or a crepe?<br /><br />Jake: Those are crepes?<br /><br />Amir: No no no no, these (holds something up) are blintzes, these (holds up a crepe) are crepes. Okay?<br /><br />Jake: Think I'm good.<br /><br />Amir: No, you're not good, until you've had one of these omelettes, Amir style: with a little bit of salt.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah I think I don't want—<br /><br />Amir: Well Amir style isn't just a little bit of salt, I lied. Okay, it's a lot of salt. And you're gonna enjoy half this thing of <br /><br />salt. But, if you were out partying last night—<br /><br />Jake: I wasn't.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, I was gonna say if you were out partying—<br /><br />Jake: I wasn't.<br /><br />Amir: Well if you were partying, then you want one of these hangover killers, this huevos rancheros, made Amir style: no salt at all.<br /><br />Jake: You have a very inconsistent style.<br /><br />Amir: Yes.<br /><br />Jake: This food looks really old.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah it's about a day old, okay. I overdid it at brunch yesterday.<br /><br />Jake: You thought you could eat all of this food at brunch?<br /><br />Amir: I jokingly said to waitress yesterday at brunch, Hey, one of everything please. She starts giggling, there's a chemistry there, <br /><br />so I smile at her, but I grab her forearm and I go, Hey, that wasn't a joke. I want one of everything, bitch. She takes me at face <br /><br />value because, you know, duality of man or whatever. Bitch starts bringing out plate by plate for like an hour and a half! We're going <br /><br />nuts! The whole restaurant's just up in arms. They start adding tables, because I'm at table for one, right, so there's not enough <br /><br />room, there's not enough area to support all these plates. After every plate she's like, Are you sure you can afford all this stuff? <br /><br />Because, you know, you've seen me on Saturday nights, I'm dressed like a vagrant or whatever. But I go, Hey, not only am I sure I'm <br /><br />gonna pay you for all this stuff, but there's a tip in it for you. I start losing it, I am going nuts, this is crazy right? At 11:30 I <br /><br />say eff it, I'm liveblogging the thing. It's going crazy, the Twitter sphere is just abuzz with this stuff. We're getting retweets, <br /><br />comments on my message board, it's absolutely ridonculous. We're going crazy in there! All of a sudden I start feeling like I'm in a <br /><br />fucking gameshow or something—<br /><br />Jake: What gameshow?<br /><br />Amir: Alright, long story shirt, I'll give you a blintz for 11 bucks instead of 12 if you promise to throw in a little extra for the <br /><br />huevos rancheros.<br /><br />Jake: Why would I pay you for your huevos rancheros?<br /><br />Amir: Alright lemme level with you man, because you're obviously not getting it. I can't afford to eat 500 dollars every time I go out. <br /><br />I can't have that on my conscience, I can't have that on my card. So, this is what I'm gonna say to you: I finish all this food in <br /><br />three minutes or less, you pay me for it. If I don't? Okay, I'll pay you double of what I paid.<br /><br />Jake: Fine.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, fine. (Takes a bite of the omelette) Ugh! I'm sorry, no. This is—(spits it out) this is too salty.<br /><br />",

(He serves the ball, Jake returns it, then Amir slams it into Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: (dodging the ball) Ow, my point! 3-0.<br /><br />AMIR: It hit you!<br /><br />JAKE: Ok it grazed me!<br /><br />AMIR: You said ow.<br /><br />JAKE: 3-0. Gimme the ball. My serve.<br /><br />AMIR: You gave me the ball.<br /><br />JAKE: Well give it back!<br /><br />(Amir tosses it back to Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: Bad throw! (He leans over to pick up the ball and smashes his forehead on the table.) OW! AHW, you're an anus. But, uh, sneak attack! (He serves the ball and it goes off the end of the table.)<br /><br />AMIR: Hey! Ok. (He retrieves the ball.)<br /><br />JAKE: Aight. Give it up.<br /><br />AMIR: But you just-- it- you just served it--<br /><br />JAKE: It was a joke. I was kidding. Give it-- Alright. 4-0. That's.. counts now. 5-0, 5-0, not-getting-the-joke penalty. Sorry Sally Jessica Raphael, that one's lost on ya. Here it is! (He serves the ball.)<br /><br />AMIR: (Returning Jake's serve) Sally Jessica Raphael...<br /><br />(Jake and Amir rally back and forth, then Amir scores a point.)<br /><br />JAKE: (Retrieving the ball.) Alright, crossed the table but I'll give it to you.<br /><br />AMIR: Wait what do you mean crossed the- like th--<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't matter what I mean, cuz I said I'd give it to you, didn't I? You need to learn how to be funny, man, I'm sorry, you need to learn how to be funny. Six-nil, you get one point for being a bitch, this one's for the skunk though.<br /><br />AMIR: The skunk?<br /><br />JAKE: Skunk! It's an 11-1 game, but hey if you don't know that, brotha, YA ALREADY SKUNKED! LATA! (He serves it into the net.<br /><br />) F***! (He throws his paddle in frustration, and a cry of pain is heard from off screen.)<br /><br />END.<br /><br />OUTRO:<br /><br />JAKE: (To the off-screen person) I feel bad, but I'm not gonna feel that bad cuz I smashed my face on the table before, alright. (Picking up a paddle from the ground) And trust me, that one hurt me more than it hurts you! Ok? (To Amir) Ah, this is gonna reserve for the skunk. Here we go!

A little upstate New York. I even got one in Allentown, PA workin' for me! Dude's a little shit though. Met him on Facebook.<br /><br />JAKE: How'd you meet the other ones?<br /><br />AMIR: Facebook. But they all weren't little shits about it.<br /><br />JAKE: Got it.<br /><br />AMIR: Jake. These kids are bringin' home 2 pillow cases full of candy, min. I skim 10% off the top and pay them double face for each piece. (Laugh)<br /><br />JAKE: So you're paying them?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, out of the nose man. I'm like Willy Wonka, baby. Chomp Chomp, bitch.<br /><br />JAKE: Willy Wonka never said that. Why would you pay them for candy bars?<br /><br />AMIR: Dude it's ridiculous. I ended up owing a kid over $800 last year for a frickin' York Peppermint Patty.  I don't know.<br /><br />JAKE: How is that two times face?<br /><br />AMIR: That one got away from me. I'll admit it. It was a slippery slope there, so.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, well you know that: A) You can buy your own candy at the store and B-<br /><br />AMIR: All right. Stop right there! Okay, because I'm not doing this for the candy, all right.<br /><br />JAKE: So why are you paying kids literally hundreds of dollars-<br /><br />AMIR: Thousands of dollars.<br /><br />JAKE: Thousands of dollars!<br /><br />AMIR: Can you just shut up one second?! I'm on Facebook Chat with this little twerp from Allentown. Now he's telling me that I have to pay for my own train ticket out there. Okay, so, how do I get back? Do I ask his dad for a ride? Clearly not because his dad's already pissed at me for talking to the 13-year-old while he's at school.<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you wearing a dress?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, all right, all right. How long have you been sitting on that question, Hurwitz? What else?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm serious. It's Thursday, it's not Halloween. There's no Halloween-<br /><br />AMIR: Laundry Day. Okay?<br /><br />JAKE: So you had no other clean clothes?<br /><br />AMIR: No! What? No! Laundry Day is when I steal shit from Laundromats. You think I bought this dress? No! I'm like Willy Freakin' Wonka.<br /><br />JAKE: You don't know who Willy Wonka is.<br /><br />AMIR: Chomp.

You just took me on a guilt trip.  Hey, that's pretty neat. Best part of all, I didn't have to drop 40K on that. (laughs) And we don't have to suffer through any all you can eat banana leaf buffets or go through any scuba diving lessons which is perfect because I'm deathly afraid of water anyways!! <br /><br />JAKE: You can't make me feel bad for how you spend your money!<br /><br />AMIR: (clapping) Bravo. Bravo. Bra--what a victim you are. You must be in the worst shape of ever.  I feel so bad for Jake.<br /><br />JAKE: Does anybody want to go to lunch?<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Guess what? That e-mail I was going to send your dad? Yeah, it was bad. It was a Trojan horse.  You know what that is? It's a computer virus that would have taken down his whole network.

Did you get my response about how I didn't want to do that?<br /><br />AMIR: All right, first up. It's a movie, but it's also a sweater. What?! You can wear it, you can watch it, you can do whatever. Looks fabulous, be good. It's sweater: the movie. <br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: So you know how every good movie is just a combination of two other movies? <br /><br />JAKE: No. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, so you're definitely not going to like Fever Hitch. <br /><br />AMIR: This one is based on a script. <br /><br />JAKE: All movies are based on a script.<br /><br />AMIR: Not documentaries!

No.<br /><br />AMIR: Stewart Thinkpen was an average guy--<br /><br />JAKE: Pass. <br /><br />AMIR: Argh, sorry, just took me forever to perfect that voice.

So the circles mean maybe? Because you've circled every single idea I've said no to. <br /><br />AMIR: The Talented Mr. Ripley's Believe It Or Not. <br /><br />JAKE: That one is not even a movie. <br /><br />AMIR: Not yet. These are pit-- Oh, I see. Rip--Yeah. Maybe. <br /><br />AMIR: Uh, all right. I think that went well. <br /><br />JAKE: It didn't. I said no to literally everything you pitched. <br /><br />AMIR: Well, now I know what you don't want to hear, so that I can sort of re-imagine everything--<br /><br />JAKE: Don't think of any more movie ideas, all right? Man, you're really bad at it and I would quit entirely. <br /><br />AMIR: Ouch. (chuckles) That is a tough pill to swallow. Heh, you got to understand that I was really jazzed about these ideas last night. I was like air-boxing with no one, writing them down, getting super jazzed. So for me to hear that, that's tough man. That's tough for me to hear. <br /><br />AMIR: (sigh) I guarantee that if you knew what you were saying to me, if you knew how much that would affect me, that you wouldn't have said half the stuff you just said. <br /><br />JAKE: I think I'm going to go. (gets up and leaves shot)<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I think I'm going to peace out too. I might take a personal day because I feel like there's a--<br /><br />JAKE: Well you just got back from a two and a half week long Mexican vacation. <br /><br />AMIR: STAYCATION!

My hamster's name is... (looks at the desk) Toilet Paper, and toilet paper...<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't ask you the hamster's name, and wow, you should have thought of a name that didn't sound like toilet paper.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, let's just blow today. Can't we just take a personal day and go for a picnic or something? I'm sure the bandit left us some sandwiches and a frisbee. <br /><br />JAKE: He didn't.<br /><br />AMIR: Check under your desk maybe it's there.<br /><br />Jake checks under the desk.<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing.<br /><br />Amir checks under the desk.<br /><br />AMIR: What!? No! How..? Who... who did... THIS (pointing at the desk)... it's what I'm pissed about.<br /><br />JAKE: The toilet paper?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Well, you know what? The bandit must have left the food and the frisbee at my apartment earlier today because he was distracted, busy with the scheming of things, so why don't we swing by my apartment and then the bandit might have to take a dump real quick.<br /><br />JAKE: The bandit or you?<br /><br />AMIR: (sighs) Alright, just cut me some slack man, at least I'm trying.<br /><br />JAKE: You're lying.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm lying because you don't trust me ever. <br /><br />JAKE: How can I trust you?

Jake! <br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I'm in here. <br /><br />Amir: Where are you? <br /><br />Jake: In the- Where are you? Right? You're in the bathroom. So, where am I? In the bathroom. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, you just left your desk two minutes ago and you didn't say anything. <br /><br />Jake: I said I'd be right back! <br /><br />Amir: sighs What does that mean? <br /><br />Jake: It means I'll be right back and not to follow me to the bathroom. <br /><br />Amir: Okay, should I chill out here, or you want me to wait for you? <br /><br />Jake: Just chi- Okay, I see what you did. Neither. Alright? Just go away. <br /><br />Amir: Hey! Let me in, okay? Somebody's coming. <br /><br />Jake: No. <br /><br />(Amir scoffs. coworker enters the bathroom) <br /><br />Amir (in a Boston accent): Hey! Get outta here! Nobody's takin' a poop here! Mind your own bees! <br /><br />(Coworker leaves) <br /><br />Jake: Hey, whoever that is, don't worry, you can go to the bathroom. It's fine. <br /><br />Amir: He already left. <br /><br />Jake: Come on man. We have to work here, right? <br /><br />Amir: How much longer do you have in there? <br /><br />Jake: I don't know, alright? I can't exactly go to the bathroom with you here talking to me. <br /><br />Amir: Fine, fine. I'll stay, but I won't say anything. <br /><br />Jake: That makes no sense, but fine. <br /><br />(Brief silence broken by Amir making a high pitched noise.)<br /><br />Amir: Hey, I read on Yahoo News that laptops are cooking people's- <br /><br />Jake (interrupting Amir): Hey man, you just said you weren't gonna say anything. <br /><br />Amir: Alright, fine, okay? Keep it mum, alright? Mum's the word. <br /><br />Jake: Thank you. <br /><br />Amir (To the tune of War by Edwin Starr): Mum! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing! <br /><br />(Amir kicks in the stall door and falls to the floor) <br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ, man! What is wrong with you? <br /><br />Amir: Me? You said no talking! That was a kick! <br /><br />Jake: Yeah, you were singing! <br /><br />Amir: Oh my god! Singing isn't talking. <br /><br />Jake: Yes it is! <br /><br />Amir: Why do I- Why do I bother? Why do I bother if you're just not gonna like it? <br /><br />[After College Humor logo, Amir is still on he floor in front of the stall.]<br /><br />Amir: It just doesn't- I don't buy it man. I'm sorry, it doesn't make sense. Why would I- Why would I do this? Like, it doesn't- It doesn't help. You don't like me. It just drives you away even more, and then mumble in the bathroom? That's so- it's cold, man. This is a waste of time. <br /><br />",

[singing jingle again] Give me a break, man. Give me a break--<br /><br />Jake: I only have one bar left.<br /><br />Amir: Which means you've had three! So give me one! Give me one of your four bars. Just give me one of the four!<br /><br />Jake: Fine! Fine! Here. Take it.<br /><br />Amir: [taking bar] No thank you. You know what? On second thought, I don't really want it. I'm watching my weight -- watching it go up. [laughs] No, I'm going to toss it, though. [throws bar in trash can]<br /><br />Jake: Why did you do that?<br /><br />Amir: I had a second thought.<br /><br />Jake: So give it back to me!<br /><br />Amir: You already gave it up, okay? It was mine to throw away. I had a second thought; I didn't want it anymore; so I threw it away. What's it to ya?<br /><br />Jake: It was my candy bar.<br /><br />Amir: You gave it to me.<br /><br />Jake: You took it from me!<br /><br />Amir: I asked you for it and you gave it to me, so it was mine. I could have done whatever I want with it, alright? It's gone now. Forget it. Let it go. It's a sunk cost. Live life without the bar.<br /><br />Jake: Fine!<br /><br />Amir: [angrily yet quietly replying] Fine! Just, ughh... [talking to himself] So, if I eat it and two days later I take a crap and it goes in the toilet, he doesn't complain about that. But if I put it in the garbage now, then it's a bigger deal. I don't understand what the difference is. It's not his. It's gone. But he just latches on. He latches on and I can't let it get to me. I just have to let it go-- IT'S A FRICKIN' KIT KAT BAR, MAN! It's 99 cents! What do you want?! A quarter? You want a quarter for it, you're going to be that petty? Just forget it, man! Just pretend that I dropped it on the ground and I didn't want to eat it -- does that make you sleep at night?<br /><br />Jake: Why don't we just move on?<br /><br />Amir: Well, I'm not going to let you sit here and sulk about it, okay? Say something! You're obviously pissed!<br /><br />Jake: Yes, I am pissed! I said I just wish you didn't throw it away.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah? Well, sometimes wishes don't come true. I'm sorry.<br /><br />Jake: Whatever.<br /><br />Amir: I mean, when I was six I had a wish, too. I had a wish that everybody I knew would be dead. How's that for a wish?<br /><br />Jake: I don't know -- selfish?<br /><br />Amir: Bet you wish that one didn't come true.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah.<br /><br />Amir: You know, if you're gonna be a bitch about it, then here: [tossing Jake an unwrapped Kit Kat bar] A full Kit Kat bar. Enjoy that, ya bitch!<br /><br />Jake: So why'd you want one of mine?<br /><br />Amir: Okay, you know what? Here! [throwing more unwrapped Kit Kats at Jake] Take the whole lot! Jakey gets all the Kit Kats. Enjoy them, ya bitch!<br /><br />Jake: Why do you have these?<br /><br />Amir: Because I buy two or three a day and I save one, okay? But I bet you knew that already, didn't you, bitch?<br /><br />Jake: I clearly didn't.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, you know what? Here's an idea: We go bar for bar -- see who can eat the most candy.<br /><br />Jake: You just said you were watching your weight.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! Watching it go up!<br /><br />Jake: So, that wasn't even a joke?<br /><br />Amir: [with mouth crammed full of multiple Kit Kat bars] Are we doing this contest, or not?!<br /><br />[END]<br /><br />",

Amir is playing with a Rubik's Cube)<br /><br />JAKE: Hey--<br /><br />AMIR: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Speak!<br /><br />JAKE: My cousin just sent me the new \"Auto Tune the News\" clip, and you know those creepy facebook wall posts you leave me?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Like the ones late at night where you--<br /><br />AMIR: Yes I remember, I don't-- you don't have to give me a history lesson. <br /><br />JAKE: Well they're a song now.<br /><br />(Jake plays a part of the song \"Poke Me\", and the accompanying video is shown. The included lyrics are: \"Poke me (poke me) / Poke my wall (poke me) / Poke my face (poke me) / Poke my pictures (poke me) / Poke my videos / I want you to poke my status / And I want you to poke yourself / Go poke yourself\")<br /><br />(Jake stops the video.)<br /><br />AMIR: What?

So she's not your cousin!<br /><br />JAKE: You can have female cousins.<br /><br />AMIR: No I can't! Okay, both my parents are only children; you knew that.<br /><br />JAKE: You have a cousin named Leron.<br /><br />AMIR: He's adopted!<br /><br />JAKE: By who?! Alright focus. Focus, okay. You're in an internet video.<br /><br />AMIR: ...what.<br /><br />JAKE: Lots of people are watching it and you look like a needy loser.<br /><br />AMIR: You look like a jerk!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not even in the video. And trust me, if I were in an internet video, nobody would think I was a jerk.<br /><br />AMIR: Ugh, this is not what I envisioned when they asked me for permission and I said yes.<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, they emailed me and asked if they could use my creepy videos to make a funny song out of it. Well, I'm not laughing!<br /><br />JAKE: So they asked for your permission. <br /><br />AMIR: (through laughter: \"Asked for my!\") They gave me final cut approval, okay? Three weeks ago they send me a rough and it just sat in my inbox. Yesterday, on a whim, I reply \"I have no notes\". I don't know what got into me; it just happened. Ninety minutes later they send me a final cut; I guess they made some last minute audio tweaks. I respond, sight unseen, \"This is f***ing gold, I'm proud to know you guys. Love, Amir\", and then, this thing!<br /><br />JAKE: So this sounds like it's mostly your fault.<br /><br />AMIR: Lemme just-- lemme see if I can ask them to take it down or something. <br /><br />(Amir gets up and walks a few feet over to where the guys from Auto Tune the News (brothers Evan, Andrew, and Michael Gregory) are standing. They greet each other and Amir kisses Andrew's hand.<br /><br />AMIR: I think that video's gotta go down or something.<br /><br />MICHAEL: If you don't want it up then we'll take it down right away.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah that's true. I dunno, I feel bad.<br /><br />ANDREW: We told you from the get-go, you've got total veto power.<br /><br />AMIR: That's true. I dunno, it is catchy.<br /><br />EVAN: Well, why don't you go take it down yourself? We made you an admin on the page.<br /><br />AMIR: Shut up okay! Maybe-- Let's just keep it up at this point.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, before you turn around and tell me that they can't delete the video, just know that I heard that entire--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah it's a no-go on the vid going down, man, I'm sorry, I talked to them but they won't budge. They're being douchebags about it!<br /><br />EVAN: (to Jake) It's not like that--<br /><br />AMIR: (over Evan) --BAH, so.<br /><br />ANDREW: (to Jake) He paid us money to do this.<br /><br />AMIR: They didn't do that. No--<br /><br />MICHAEL: (holding his phone) I just took it down.<br /><br />AMIR: DON'T DELETE IT! Put it back up then! (Pulls phone out of pocket) I can actually, I'm an admin, right?

Amir is singing the wrong lyrics, trying to put the lyrics of \"Bed Intruder\" in. Eventually Amir takes over.)<br /><br />AMIR: (Singing to the tune of \"Bed Intruder\") You don't have to poke, I'll be poke. They're looking for poke. They're gon' find you. They're gon' find poke. And you can poke and--<br /><br />MICHAEL: (singing falsetto) Shawty...<br /><br />EVAN: That is... That's an *idea*.<br /><br />AMIR: (mocking Evan's tone) It's a good *idea*.

I get runner-up, second-best joke of lunch with the too slow thing, looks like I'm too school for school (laughs); sorry just kidding, too COOL for school, not a mess-up because I caught it first. Once again y'all are too slow and once again Julian Assand can-- (pelvic thrusts) ah!ah! --eat a penis pie 'til the day he die. This has been a Jake Hurwitz production, a.k.a.: I'M OUT!<br /><br />(Jake gets up from the table, and awkward silence ensues.)<br /><br />PAT: That was weird.<br /><br />SARAH: Yeah--<br /><br />AMIR: (to Pat) That wasn't weird! That was funny! YOUR joke was weird!<br /><br />SARAH: Anyway, Amir, Julian Assange is the founder of Wikileaks, this website, and he recently got arrested for sexual assault on a Swedish warrant, so. It's kinda like an international--<br /><br />(Jake comes back to the table.)<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot all my food, but if you guys are still talking about Julian Assange, he's the frickin founder of Wikileaks!<br /><br />AMIR: What's Wikileaks?<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta learn how to be funny, man. I'll tell you.. I'll tell you exactly what Wikileaks is, right now, if you can catch my low five.<br /><br />(Jake offers out his hand like before, and Amir slaps it before Jake retracts his hand.)<br /><br />JAKE: Too slow!<br /><br />AMIR: I touched it!<br /><br />JAKE: Ya knicked it!<br /><br />AMIR: I slapped it!--<br /><br />JAKE: (desperate) You KNICKED it!<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

Amir is typing on his laptop and laughing.)<br /><br />JAKE: Hey- dude! I'm not gonna ask you again. Stop responding to this email thread.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, you're getting them?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! We're getting them! Are you not getting them? Eleven people have replied and asked you to stop!<br /><br />AMIR: Stop what? We're having a good time!<br /><br />JAKE: Darren's fiance is in the hospital.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay... didn't know that.<br /><br />JAKE: How could you not know that, this entire thread has been about that.<br /><br />AMIR: That's not true, a lot of my emails are about other., stuff.<br /><br />JAKE: No! They're not, and they're really offensive! Like you said I got a gift idea: a new fiance, because his is broken. Does anybody have the number for the slut store? I left mine in Darren's dick LOL. What does that mean?<br /><br />AMIR: (pauses and holds his arms up like Jake doesn't get it) It doesn't mean anyth- it's a joke! It's a joke!<br /><br />JAKE: Is it? Is this one also a joke? I saw Darren's fiance eating a cockmeat sandwich last night. Need proof? See attached pic., with no picture attached.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok I followed up on that.<br /><br />JAKE: You did, five seconds later you said Sorry for the bogus attachment, y'all. Click here to see Darren's finance--spelled that wrong...<br /><br />AMIR: Auto-corrected.<br /><br />JAKE: It's not. You said Click here to see Darren's finance in all her glory holes., but there's no link. Five seconds later you follow up with a link to a random GeoCities page that says Under Construction.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I started that in seventh grade. Gave up on it, right quick. (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: Ok, well either way--<br /><br />AMIR: You know I've been thinking about dusting it off, you know taking it out for a spin again, maybe turning it into like a webzine, or like a fanzine of sorts--<br /><br />JAKE: For what?<br /><br />AMIR: (mocking Jake). For what?. Can I ask you a question, why do you never believe in me?<br /><br />JAKE: Focus. Alright this is the last thing I'll say, and it's not directly related to this specific thread, but you gotta change your email signature, man.<br /><br />AMIR: Why?<br /><br />JAKE: (The camera shows a shot of Amir's signature, which is ASCII art of a naked woman posing on her knees, with Amir written underneath.) It's porn.<br /><br />AMIR: It's art!<br /><br />JAKE: Barely.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright want me to teach you? The trick is to do Shift-2 when you want to draw a pussy. Now, let's talk about that fanzine for a sec. I'm gonna lobby you some ideas and you say Yes! if they're good, Totally!, if they're bad, and I love it! if you love it.<br /><br />JAKE: Ok so yes, totally, and I love it?<br /><br />AMIR: Yea.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, so it sounds like you're just trying to protect yourself against negative feedback.<br /><br />AMIR: Yea I don't like negativity.<br /><br />JAKE: Really? You could've fooled me, cuz you just sent this email, five seconds ago, while we were talking, and it's Darren's fiance with a skull and crossbones Photoshopped above her head, and it says Rest In Pieces.<br /><br />AMIR: (Agitated) Ok you gotta believe me, man. I got a photo of her eating a cockmeat sandwich, I was just too afraid to send it out. I'll put it on the fanzine!<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

(Points at button)  That's clearly a choice, right?<br /><br />JAKE: We're putting my childhood pet to sleep and all you can focus on is my cool vest.<br /><br />AMIR: I didn't say it was cool.<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry, stylish.<br /><br />AMIR: I definitely didn't call it stylish.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, well, it doesn't matter 'cause it's comin' off!  (Starts to unbutton vest)<br /><br />AMIR: Is that a...is that a watch?  (Gestures towards Jake's wrist)<br /><br />JAKE: (Checks wrist) No, there's no-there's not watch-head on it so it's just like a band.  (Rotates wrist to show Amir)<br /><br />AMIR: Why...all the effort?  Why're you wearing a leather band?<br /><br />JAKE: (Sarcasm) Oh my god it's so hard to put a band around your wrist and snap it in.  (Demonstrate)<br /><br />AMIR: I'm saying, like, goin' to the mall, that's like a lot of effort.  <br /><br />JAKE: (Sarcasm) Lots of effort to take a quick bus ride over the GW bridge and you thumb it down  to an Abercromie.  What's hard about that?  And guess what, I didn't pay a friggin' dime 'cause I ganked it!  Ah ha.  (Jake gets a phone call) (Suddenly upset) Oh, one second.  (Picks up phone)  Hello?...No, there's nothing you can do.  Why could-how-you already couldn't do anything...I understand. (Puts hand over face)<br /><br />AMIR: Is the cat gone?<br /><br />JAKE: No, it was Urban Outfitters.  My custom J-Witz dog tags aren't gonna be ready 'till late this afternoon.<br /><br />AMIR: Dog tags?<br /><br />JAKE: (Pulls out a dog tag from under his shirt) Yeah, dog tags, like this one.<br /><br />AMIR: So you're already wearing one?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, well you need two!  Or was Justin Timberlake at the 2002 Kid's Choice Awards NOT styling?  <br /><br />(Amir looks confused)<br /><br />JAKE: (Sarcasm) Oh, yeah,  I bet he wasn't fucking Britney Spears.  (Puts on another dog tag)<br /><br />AMIR: So you have two?<br /><br />JAKE: YOU NEED FOUR!  Alright?  Or was Chris Kirkpatrick at the 2008 NOT styling?<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysX71Wv8GyQ<br /><br />",

Hey, listen. Can I borrow your phone? I just got beeped.<br /><br />JAKE: You have a phone.<br /><br />AMIR: Upgraded it. Alright, I'm living in beepersville now. (kisses beeper) Oh! That's cherry.<br /><br />JAKE: That's not an upgrade.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, ya Steve Jobs f*cker, sorry it's not a frickin' iPad Nano, just give me your phone, I gotta call someone back.<br /><br />JAKE: Use your desk phone!<br /><br />AMIR: I gotta call this number back 'cause it says 9-1-1 at the end of it which means emergency, okay, and if I don't get back to it soon then it's gonna beep me again anyway!<br /><br />JAKE: (passing his phone) Alright, just don't cry! (simultaneously) God, here.<br /><br />AMIR: (simultaneously) I just need something.<br /><br />JAKE: You cry to get your way like a four-year-old, that's so pathetic. That is ridiculous.<br /><br />AMIR: (on phone) Yellow? Yes, the doctor speaking. Alright, this is what you need to do, uh, I'm thinking 20 CC's of dialysis administered vaginally. Which is- yeah. No, I- uh- nurse. (chuckling) I'm sorry, I went to medical school. Alright, I get paid the big bucks to make the boo-boos go away. So, (chuckles). Talk back again and we'll make it 40 CC's. Alright, make that 60. Great. Alright, 80 CC's, keep talking. Thank you. Alright, bye, 100 CC's. (hangs up)<br /><br />JAKE: Where did you get that beeper?<br /><br />AMIR: I didn't get it. Ok, I ganked it. <br /><br />JAKE: That's still getting it.<br /><br />AMIR: Why, where did you gank yours? Radio shack? You know I'm surprised that you can even talk to me right now with Steve Jobs' balls in your mouth.<br /><br />JAKE: You're being really crass today. How did you get a beeper from a doctor's office?   <br /><br />AMIR: Bachelor party last weekend. Yeah, my friend from high school, Marty's getting married so you know I came to play. (laughs) First step is a nice, little brunch with his family and I'm already a little buzzed after three Four Lokos and a shot of schnapps, some bozo jokingly dares me to bite into a glass of orange juice. (laughs) Before he even gets to the just kidding I am tooth-deep in the thing. I'm not an idiot, okay, so I think the thing's gonna crack but my eyes widen with fear when the bitch explodes in my mouth. I'm talking razor-sharp glass shards just cutting my mouth up from uvula to incisor, there was blood everywhere. Alright, next thing I know I'm in the back of Donnie's Camaro, he's the best man, and people are just begging me not to fall asleep. I'm laughing maniacally, my face is like a blood-sprinkler, the red liquid's just shooting everywhere, getting on the interior and stuff. To make matters worse I wasn't even invited to the frickin' thing. So I start passing out, you know, Nature's Promise and all.<br /><br />JAKE: That's a butter company.<br /><br />AMIR: I wake up in post-op four hours later and I needed 31 stitches to close me shut, nurse is livid, just crying in the corner because I've been shitting myself nonstop which sounds standard, but it's not.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound standard.<br /><br />AMIR: They choose this golden moment to give me a hospital bill. Uh-oh, daddy doesn't have health insurance. So I book it, alright. Cut to interior, hospital, day, later, I am barreling skull-first into a doctor, right into his chest, and he gets plowed to the floor. Medical equipment everywhere, alright. The beeper falls onto the ground and I just jump on it like a Nazi taking a grenade for his German cohorts. He looks passed out, but I'm not gonna take that risk, okay, so I shove the beeper three inches into my butt and I just take off in a dead sprint due north, remember that direction 'cause it's gonna come in handy later. I'm three towns over before I even realize nobody's chasing me and at that point I'm thanking God because my groin is torn to shreds.<br /><br />JAKE: So that beeper was in your butt?<br /><br />AMIR: For 14 miles. And the bitch still works. (winks)<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

Uh, there are a lot of duplicates here, like the first nine say \"Find treasure\".<br /><br />Amir: Really? Because duplicate means two, and you said the first nine are find treasure.

Elevators, man, right? (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: I told you not to talk to me for the rest of the day.<br /><br />AMIR: I was just in an elevator, ok, and nobody was looking at anyone. It was really uncomfortable!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you still do that thing where you enter the elevator backwards?--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! You know, so I'm facing the RIGHT way in case of emergency; it's just a safety precaution.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright well people don't wanna look at each other in elevators; it's sort of uncomfortable.<br /><br />AMIR: So I try to break the silence; you know, add a little warmth and comradery to this otherwise awkward elevator ride. You n- wanna know what I said?<br /><br />JAKE: Something about the weather?<br /><br />AMIR: No, that's boring. Ok I wanted to do something that they would REMEMBER me by. So I asked them, straight up, if you had to choose, which one would you rather have: eight legs, or two really long, eight-foot arms.<br /><br />JAKE: (gesturing out noodley arms) Like, telescopic, noodley arms?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, just like giant noodles for arms.<br /><br />JAKE: Giant noodle arms.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Or what was the other one? Eight legs?<br /><br />AMIR: Eight legs like a spider.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow. Yeah.. that's stupid.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly, right? Difficult question; I don't even know which one--<br /><br />JAKE: I said stupid.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well it is very difficult. Which one would you rather have?<br /><br />JAKE: Look, I said it was a stupid question, not in intelligent question; you're taking what I'm saying and turning it around--<br /><br />AMIR: Eight legs. Hm. I knew you'd take their side.<br /><br />JAKE: (sighs.) How was the reaction?<br /><br />AMIR: Muted. Mm-hmm. Lotta noise; lotta noise.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know what muted means?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes. Well, now I do.<br /><br />(Jake smiles gestures with his hand as if saying what are you talking about?)<br /><br />AMIR: What is with elevators, ok why is it so uncomfortable in there? Why is nobody allowed to talk to anybody? (in a stand up comedy cadence) What is it, like a library in there? I'm gonna check out a book, in an elevator?<br /><br />JAKE: You trying to do a stand up act, or something?<br /><br />AMIR: (to the camera) HOW can we break the ice.. in elevators, ok? We wanna know! ...So submit your answers right here! (pointing down)<br /><br />OUTRO:<br /><br />(The Jake  Amir's Get Together Project Animation plays)<br /><br />AMIR: People! Let's get closer!<br /><br />JAKE: Join our Get Together Project at Facebook.com/BACARDI<br /><br />AMIR: So why'd you choose legs, man? I was like positive you were an arm guy.<br /><br />JAKE: AhhI dunno.<br /><br />AMIR: Think about it, ok? I don't wanna just talk to hear the sound of my own voice, I want you to put something back--<br /><br />JAKE: That's what you usually do anyway.<br /><br />AMIR: How dare you accuse me of talking on and on and on, with no seeming reason or rhyme to where I'm going, or how--<br /><br />JAKE: You see what you're doing now?<br /><br />END.<br /><br />",

I'm surprised you even realised it.<br /><br />Jake: It's not.<br /><br />Amir: Subtle but much better.<br /><br />Jake: It's neither. God, you look really weird when you talk like that, too. <br /><br />Amir: What are you trying--, this is my--, this is how I talk. This is natural for me, okay? I've been trying to talk like a high-pitched fool for the last four years.<br /><br />Jake: That's not natural.

Let them think that you stole it. It's honestly better for me.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I--. I've never s--. You're being so mean right now. If you're gonna steal it and not clarify that you stole it from me when people accuse you of stealing it, at least admit that you're being mean right now.<br /><br />Jake: Listen man, I know. I'll be the first to admit it's a dick move.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I was the first to admit it.<br /><br />Jake: No, it's a dick move. I'm well aware of that. <br /><br />Amir: I--. Yeah, well.<br /><br />Jake: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, But what would you do in my position, if you had a voice this chill?<br /><br />Amir: I would keep the voice<br /><br />Jake: Obviously.<br /><br />Amir: But I would clarify that if people thought that you stole it--<br /><br />Jake: No. No. You're saying that because that's what you want. Not 'cause that's what you'd do in my position. Ok? You gotta learn how to empathize man.<br /><br />Amir: (crying)<br /><br />Jake: Don't, don't. Come on, that's not even crying.<br /><br />Amir: What are you--<br /><br />Jake: What? Yeah, I can lose the voice and then pick it back up. Doesn't mean shit.<br /><br />Amir: You're not even doing it right.<br /><br />Jake: Oh, I'm doing it right because this is my voice and you stole it from me. Ok? My voice rules, your voice drools, how's that for fair?<br /><br />Pat: Jake, I was being sarcastic. It's not a cool voice.<br /><br />Jake: Uhm, no slit bitch. I know, I like my regular voice just fine, thank you.<br /><br />Amir: So, I can keep--<br /><br />Jake: I reserve the right to take it back, okay? Pending a second opinion.

Guess what? I was lying. It was due south. How's that for a mind fudge? So, I s...<br /><br />Jake: Hey, hey. I just got this e-mail that you sent to the entire company and, um, nobody's going to believe you're doing a triathlon for charity.<br /><br />Amir: Ooh, this kitten's got claws. He he.<br /><br />Jake: Right, so they're not going to donate any money to you.<br /><br />Amir: Rerh! (kitten screech) He he. Rerh. He he. ...Why not?<br /><br />Jake: For starters, you began the e-mail by saying Dear Suckers.<br /><br />Amir: Yea, as in deer suckers. Like little possums.<br /><br />Jake: So, that makes even less sense than I originally thought. Secondly, triathlons are running, swimming and biking, not drinking, fucking and stealing ya'lls cash.<br /><br />Amir: Cash money, ain't nothin funny.<br /><br />Jake: That's not a response to what I just said.<br /><br />Amir: Fo'sho!<br /><br />Jake: Look, even if they get past the beginning of this e-mail, the next part is a picture of you in a jewelry store, holding a diamond watch, with the caption: I want dis.<br /><br />Amir: You don't understand, man. I want dis.<br /><br />Jake: That's the only thing I understand.<br /><br />Amir: Ok! If you don't want to make the donation just put in like $150 and then click send. And when goes Are you sure you want to make the donation? click on No. If it's that hard, i'll do...i'll click on it.<br /><br />Jake: I just got a follow-up e-mail: It's come to my attention that you guys think this is a bogus goof. I legit want/need dis watch. Blew your cover there. Then, three follow up e-mails that say: Please disregard, please disregard, please disregard. One more, though. Just one sentence long and it says: Come on, douches. Help out the cause. And it's a photo shopped picture of you shitting on Bill Cosby.<br /><br />Amir: That was a Jello pudding snack.<br /><br />Jake: That was a Jello pudding snack, ok. It's kinda weird, though, that you have a legit picture of you taking a shit.<br /><br />Amir: Yea, the Cos loves his Jello pudding sweaters.<br /><br />Jake: Final e-mail: Please recall all e-mails. Somebody's being a bitch. And it's a photo shopped picture of Bill Cosby shitting on me, which is extra weird because you somehow got a photo of Bill Cosby taking a shit?<br /><br />Amir: The Cos has to poop, eventually, sir. And it's just about finding the right f...<br /><br />Jake: How are you so fast at photo shop?<br /><br />Amir: It's all about doing it real crudely and quickly.<br /><br />Jake: Not very crudely. They're fine lines.<br /><br />Amir: Yea, the trick is to make it look like it's very good, but it's actually not that good.<br /><br />Jake: You gotta stop it with that impression.<br /><br />Amir: Yea, well at least I don't spit when I talk!<br /><br />Jake: Do I do that?<br /><br />Amir: No!

[put hands together and bows]<br /><br />J: That's really offensive.<br /><br />A: I just really needed to get out of the house, so I appreciate it.<br /><br />J: Okay, well I'm still pretty pissed at you about last night.<br /><br />A: [confused] ...Is this like an inside joke based on something that happened, because I'm sorry, I was a little bit gone.<br /><br />J: You were ENTIRELY gone, okay? You showed up three hours late and you were begging to the point of tears to change the locashe.<br /><br />A: Yeah, I say a LOT of funny things. <br /><br />J: It wasn't funny. You openly wept for a venue change for my friend's birthday party at her apartment to a quote college dive around the corner from this shithole.<br /><br />A: I thought the party needed a new energy, okay?! [starts waving his hands and dancing] Sometimes nights are about what kind of energy you're able to infuse -<br /><br />J: [interrupting] Right, no, no, no, I get that, but the party had a fine energy, right? They were lighting the birthday candles and then you blew them all out and you said Happy birthday to pee! and then you whipped out your penis and tried to urinate on the cake - but couldn't -<br /><br />A: [interrupting, irritated/defensive] I had just drained the main vein...like 25 seconds earlier.<br /><br />J: Okay, I'm not upset that you couldn't pee, I'm upset that you tried. Then you ran outside and a few of us followed you because you yelled I'm gonna go outside and legit hurt myself to teach you all a fucking lesson.<br /><br />A: A lot of the girls last night were slumpbusters, can we talk about THAT for a second?<br /><br />J: Not right now, okay? Once we were outside you asked my friend if she dared you to headbutt the windshield of a car until it broke. When she said no, you took off in a dead sprint and said You owe me five bucks, you sasquatch! and then you lowered your head and ran full speed into the bumper of a truck.<br /><br />[one cut during Jake's speech of Amir bobbing his head]<br /><br />A: That reminds me; that slumpbusting sasquatch owes me a five-spot. An Abe Lincolner.<br /><br />J: We heard a DEAFENING crack - like a log being broken over a rock - and you fell completely motionless to the ground. We thought you had broke your neck.<br /><br />A: [trying to imitate Mike Posner] You probably think, you think you're cooler than me.<br /><br />[Jake glares at Amir, who blinks slowly]<br /><br />J: ...your legs didn't work anymore after that, so you started scooting down the street on your butt, screaming I'm Lieutenant Dan! See if you can keep up with me, ya GUMPS!, but you were moving like, 2 inches every minute.<br /><br />A: [shaking his head] ...no...<br /><br />J: Yes, okay?! Is this the first time you're getting a little embarrassed?<br /><br />[cut to Amir still shaking his head, then back to Jake]<br /><br />J: Okay, I'm gonna keep on going...Okay, you whipped out your penis ONE more time; you said, follow my trail of pee to victory, but once again, you could not produce any urine - <br /><br />A: [angry] I HAD JUST DRAINED - <br /><br />J: [interrupting] The main vein. No, I remember that. Do you remember the skateboarder that rode by? He saw your penis and laughed at you?<br /><br />A: [squints and scratches his chin, then looks at Jake] ...Vaguely?<br /><br />J: You started crying? You said, Let's see your guido dick! I have a big penis and you have a string beanis!<br /><br />A: [rubbing his fingers on his temple] I'm sorry, is there a point to this story?<br /><br />J: You asked me why I was mad.<br /><br />A: [angry] Why don't you ask me why I'M mad, okay?! You take me to a slumpbuster festival, I haven't gotten any in like weeks - I'm on a 2-month dry spell - and EVERYBODY is outta my league.<br /><br />J: [confused] You just said it was a slumpbuster festival, now they're out of your league?<br /><br />A: THEY'RE BOTH, OKAY. I'm a 1, and they're 3s!!<br /><br />J: Just stop for one second and listen to me.<br /><br />A: [leans back, fumbling, unbuckles his belt and pants] No, you stop and listen to PEE.<br /><br />[Amir attempts to pee, Jake starts to look away, but looks back]<br /><br />J: ...Nothing.<br /><br />A: [leans forward] I just drained the main vein like a DAY ago.

Alright, how was that bitch? <br /><br />Jake: You just ruined it! <br /><br />[Jake and Amir at their desks, both laughing] <br /><br />Jake: laughs Oh, that does make sense because the subway wasn't running today. <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I know. I was just down there and I pressed the emergency breaks, you know? Which brings the whole thing to like a standstill. And we were stuck down there for like... a day. laughs<br /><br />Jake: Yes! I remember you came up above ground finally and everyone was chanting Asshole!<br /><br />Amir (powdering his face): Yeah, that's not the first time that's happened. laughs<br /><br />Jake: Whoa... <br /><br />Amir: Yeah, third grade talent show, decided to do standup comedy but my material was a little... raunchy. laughs I was booed off the stage, but my dad was so embarrassed that he moved. <br /><br />Jake: Alright, that's sad, but I was talking about the makeup. <br /><br />Amir: What? <br /><br />Jake: You're putting powder on your face. <br /><br />Amir: Yeah. I have oily skin. It's a greasy t-zone. <br /><br />Jake: Do you wash your face? <br /><br />Amir: Don't need to. laughs I just use the powder. <br /><br />Jake: Then you do need to wash you-<br /><br />Amir (interrupting Jake): The trick is to make it look like you're not wearing a lot. <br /><br />Jake: That's the trick for girls. The trick for guys is just to never wear any makeup. <br /><br />Amir (closing his compact): Alright, lemme tell you a story. In sixth grade, I was bullied so hard that my dad almost moved. Instead, my teacher called a parental mediation session. So it was just me and my dad, the tormenter and the tormenter's foster mom. They all ganged up on me so hard, that my dad moved. <br /><br />Jake: Sorry, your dad ganged up on you so hard that he moved? <br /><br />Amir (powdering his face): Yes. <br /><br />Jake: How does this relate to oily skin? <br /><br />Amir: It doesn't relate to oily skin. Okay? I just wear makeup, alright? Maybe you should care about your personal appearance too. You might look a little better. <br /><br />Jake: Stand up! <br /><br />(Amir stands up) <br /><br />Jake: Turn around! <br /><br />(Amir turns around) <br /><br />Jake: Great! I just wanted to make sure I was getting fashion advice from the guy who shit his pants three weeks ago and has yet to clean them. <br /><br />Amir: Ooh! Easy fix! (powders his butt) <br /><br />Jake: That's not- No! That doesn't fix it. <br /><br />Amir: Says the guy who got his pubes waxed everyday for like a month. <br /><br />Jake: I didn't do that. <br /><br />Amir: I'm talking about me. And you know what? I developed such a bad rash after my 30th full brazilian in as many days that you know what my dad did? <br /><br />Jake: Moved? <br /><br />Amir: He frickin' moved!<br /><br />",

They're half your age?<br /><br />Amir: I was held back. Constantly, if you must know. Eight straight years in second grade before I decided to turn it on. Alright, I flip it on like a light switch. I'm powering through third, fourth, fifth grade, sixth grade comes along, I open my stupid little trap, and the hammer comes down!<br /><br />Jake: So you didn't talk for four years?<br /><br />Amir: Not a peep! Alright, but then they find out that my reading is still at a second grade level and my math just isn't there.<br /><br />Jake: So it sounds like you didn't turn it on.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, turns out I just left it off. They shipped me back to second grade with my tail between my legs and every teacher in the hallway just booing me. I spent another nine and a half spottin' second grade. I didn't say a peep the entire time! But hey, at this point, they're already hip to that game so they just keep me there.<br /><br />Jake: So you didn't talk for ten years?<br /><br />Amir: Not a peep.<br /><br />Jake: Stop saying peep.<br /><br />Amir: Mum was the fricken' peep.<br /><br />Jake: That's enough.

Alright dude, I'll stop doing it.<br /><br />Amir: They're tutoring me.<br /><br />Jake: They're tutoring you? Okay, yeah, and my shirts grey [sarcastic].<br /><br />Teenager 2: Your shirt is grey.<br /><br />Jake: Its steel! Okay! Why don't I tutor you in having eyes.<br /><br />Amir: They're tutoring me in math, English, Physics...<br /><br />Jake: Oh, they're tutoring you in math? Here's a pop quiz, eight times eight.<br /><br />Amir: Ah, eight squared! You guys just taught me this.<br /><br />Jake: Woah, woah,woah, excuse me dude, eight squared? I said eight times eight!

Alright look, either way he's not gonna get it.<br /><br />Teenager 3: Come on Amir! You can do it!<br /><br />Jake: Woah, woah, woah! Foul on the play! No doing that dude. You can't encourage him. He's got to do it himself. <br /><br />Teenager 1: He is.<br /><br />Jake: Not with you guys smiling at him, believing in him, saying [Jake starts in a mocking voice] Oh Amir, come on you can do it! You coddle him like a child. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, 64!<br /><br />Jake: [Starts clapping] Bravo. Bravo. You guys tutored him to cheat, with a calculator under the desk. [Jake bends down to look under the desk and bangs his forehead down on top of it.] AH! Oh, no. Ow! Okay, no calculator under there but ay, who left this desk here? Haha. [Jake starts looking bad and puts his hand on his stomach] I'm gonna vomit.<br /><br />Teenager 1: You should lie down.<br /><br />Jake: You should lie up! Who are you!

The first one ended up insanely well but there's no way in hell she's ever going to go out with me again.  Two of the girls I gave pink eye to.

I want one thing, and one thing only. A one night stand. Only at the end of the night, we won't be standing. I want to lay down and hug you. <br /><br />JAKE: That's sad.  Tell me about where you grew up. <br /><br />AMIR: A lot of girls don't like guys that kiss and tell. Well, let me be frank with you, yet again, sweetheart. I never kiss, and always tell. (chuckles) I keep telling people how much I've never kissed. <br /><br />JAKE: Do you realize you haven't answered a single one of my questions?<br /><br />AMIR: And at the conclusion of the night, we walk home, I rub my hand against the dirty park bench, and just start rubbing your eyes.<br /><br />JAKE: So, the pink eye thing.  It's kind of a miracle the other 3 dates didn't get it.   <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well they probably did. <br /><br />JAKE: All right, well like I said, I don't know anyone who would want to go out with you. <br /><br />AMIR: Sorry. Is this still in character, like we're on the date?<br /><br />JAKE: No. <br /><br />AMIR: (getting worked up) What do you mean, no?<br /><br />JAKE: I mean, I don't want to do this anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: Is this why you invited me to this restaurant?

What are you even doing here?<br /><br />RICK: Well, you know I'm Amir's broker?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't know that; I thought you were his bookie.<br /><br />RICK: Well, bookies are for thugs. Brokers are for mugs! (He and Amir smile cheesily.)<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta stop it with the puns, I don't know who told you you were good--<br /><br />AMIR: Basically I give Rick money, you know, MY money, and he invests it in basketball games, baseball games,--<br /><br />RICK: Sports of that nature.<br /><br />JAKE: So it sounds like you're still a bookie.<br /><br />RICK: I also bought him a share of Dell.<br /><br />AMIR: Dude. I'm getting a share of Dell.<br /><br />JAKE: Just one share?<br /><br />RICK: Yeah, I woulda bought him more, but he just lost forty Gs on the 1982 Miss Universe Pageant.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeeah, Rick said that Miss East Germany was due, but uh, guess not. That was a big vig for the fantastic Mr. Fox--<br /><br />AMIR and RICK: eeheheh HENRY! HENRY! HENRY!--<br /><br />JAKE: Stop! Stop.<br /><br />(Rick's phone rings; the contact who is calling is Giant Egg, whose picture is of a fried egg. Rick looks at the phone, gets nervous, and hangs up the call, putting his phone down.)<br /><br />JAKE: I saw that.<br /><br />RICK: No you didn't.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, I did, it looked like you got a c--<br /><br />RICK: --Call from a giant egg? Impossible.<br /><br />JAKE: Then why are you being so defensive about it?<br /><br />RICK: Ok, look man. (covering the stack of egg cartons with she bloody-shouldered shirt from Zombie) I need you guys to do me an omelette-sized favor.<br /><br />AMIR: Anything!<br /><br />JAKE: ..No!..<br /><br />RICK: Look, in about thirty minutes, a slew of farmers and cops are gonna come in here, looking for me.<br /><br />JAKE: We said no.<br /><br />RICK: Well, they're gonna be talking all sorts of insane BS, about how I've stolen thousands of--<br /><br />JAKE: --Eggs?<br /><br />RICK: No. What?<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) What? I'm like..<br /><br />RICK: Tractors!<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) I dunno..<br /><br />RICK: You seriously have a sick obsession.<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) You're like- What is wrong with you, man?<br /><br />RICK: Was your mom a.. a chicken or something?<br /><br />AMIR: Were you frickin' laid, man? Were you frickin like hatched, bro?<br /><br />JAKE: HE'S the one that comes in here cracking eggs-- you know what, never mind.<br /><br />RICK: Anyway, look. I need you guys.. to say that I was never here.<br /><br />JAKE: Absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: (looks to where Rick was sitting, sees nothing, then holds up an egg) He's gone!<br /><br />JAKE: He's not gone. He walked like two feet; he's behind that plant.<br /><br />(The camera pans to show Rick standing behind the plant, clearly visible.)<br /><br />JAKE: (to Rick) You know you're not doing that good a job of hiding.<br /><br />(Rick puts a finger to his mouth to say shh, then opens his lips and pushes out an egg with his tongue, pointing his finger at Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: At least move behind the main branch!<br /><br />(Rick looks over at the main branch, then shakes his head no in response to Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: (throwing his arms up) Okay.<br /><br />AMIR: He's fine!<br /><br />JAKE: He's not fine!<br /><br />RICK: (in a hushed tone) I'm fine!

You sign every single post Amir Valerie Blumenfeld. <br /><br />AMIR: My blog is a one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring dad around here. This ain't no place for dads. <br /><br />JAKE: Really bad slogan, dude. <br /><br />AMIR: That's why I barely even used it, dude. <br /><br />JAKE: It's everywhere on the front page. Like a lot. <br /><br />AMIR: Barely on there.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't say barely, you're scrolling right now.  Look, I can see you counting, if you're counting then it's too many.<br /><br />AMIR: It's too many. <br /><br />JAKE: These sex tips are like, really out there.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's about being confident, sexy and fabulous. OK? Guys can tell, trust me. <br /><br />JAKE: This one says put a (bleep) on it (bleep)(bleep)(bleep)(bleep)(bleep) until he bleeds.<br /><br />AMIR: Did you know that a praying mantis have one spouse, one spouse for their entire life. OK, we can learn a lot from that. <br /><br />JAKE: That's not true. <br /><br />AMIR: It's on the blog. <br /><br />JAKE: That doesn't make it a fact, man. I think you confuse them with penguins because right here you wrote, in all caps, penguins eat their husbands.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, how about this for a true fact--<br /><br />JAKE: If it's about praying mantises, I don't want to know. (pause) So it was.<br /><br />AMIR: (mockingly) So you were. <br /><br />JAKE: That's not what I said. If you're going to mock me, at least listen to what--<br /><br />AMIR: Praying mantises can screw for 9 hours straight, OK? It's the most tantric sex you could ever imagine and I'm just supposed to sit on my fat butt and not blog about that? Like, no, I can't, what are you tal--<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I'm also realizing that a lot of your tips of the day are really mean, the same thing, and not tips. Like this one says 'my blog is the one stop shop for mom and pop, but don't bring your dad around here. This ain't no place for dads.' <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's called reverse psychology, OK? I say it ain't no place for dads--<br /><br />JAKE: All your other tips say 'long hair makes you look like a horse'!<br /><br />AMIR: Pony tails...are for ponies. <br /><br />JAKE: Delete your blog. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, if you could just give me one bit of advice. Just one suggestion, because right now I feel like it's coming--<br /><br />JAKE: It's delete the whole thing. <br /><br />AMIR: After that, all right? Next tip, OK, let's say--<br /><br />JAKE: I guess the slogan. OK? It's kind of redundant to say 'dont' bring your dad around here' and then also say 'this ain't no place for dads'.  <br /><br />AMIR: You just lost all your credibility like that. (attempts to snap)<br /><br />JAKE: Ooo, you can't snap. <br /><br />AMIR: No, but Widely agreed that that slogan was the smartest thing I ever came up with.<br /><br />JAKE: Who agreed with that?<br /><br />AMIR: My friend Widely.<br /><br />JAKE: Your friends have the stupidest names I've ever heard--<br /><br />AMIR: YEAH, well you look like a short-haired horse! <br /><br />(blackout)<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I was thinking more about your fashion blog, and maybe I could help you out by writing a column.  Maybe then people will go to it. It'll be like J-Witz talking about fedo-do's, leather bands, vests . . . <br /><br />AMIR: Nah, I'm OK.

Everybody-Like every rando with a smartphone and an AOL account could just access my pics.<br /><br />Jake:  Your pics?  You have one facebook album titled 'Another Day at the Races' and there's only one photo in here and it appears to be you at a dog pound bottomless with peanut butter all over your flaccid penis, you're surrounded by ten puppies and each one of them is ignoring you. <br /><br />Amir:  I need to untag it.<br /><br />Jake:  You need to delete it from the internet entirely.

Look at the groups you're a member of.<br /><br />Amir:  I am calm.<br /><br />Jake:  'One million strong against the new facebook,'  '10 million strong against the facebook redesign,' '100 million to say that Facebook is spying on us,' 'Amir Blumenfelds of the world unite.'  This last one, 'If one billion people join this group I'll slam my nuts in the door.'  All of them you're the only member, and this last one you uploaded the video... [clicks] It's you slamming your nuts in the door!  Why would you do that before anybody joined?<br /><br />Amir:  Because I wanted to sweeten the deal!  Alright, I wanted to let people know what was in store for them if they signed up for the frickin' group!<br /><br />Jake:  So you actually just went and slammed your nuts in the door?!<br /><br />Amir:  Well, ah, ok, here's the thing.  I got amped up, right, I was trying to pump myself up to actually do the video one day and I said you know what, I'm ready, so I end up slamming my nuts in the door, and what am I gonna do?  Just sit on the video? No, I decided to upload it, and you know what?-<br /><br />Jake: [interrupts] It has three views!<br /><br />Amir:  Exactly!  And you know what?  Those three views they're probably all from a frickin' Skymall and Zark Fuckerberg he's walking around right now with massage boots over his head because it's a kickback from the frickin' mall!<br /><br />",

Why am I dressed like a champion?<br /><br />Jake: Did you walk to work today?<br /><br />Amir: Ooh... impressed?<br /><br />Jake: It's 28 degrees outside.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, it was a little cold, but -uh- it's worth it.<br /><br />Jake: Your legs turned purple.<br /><br />Amir (hitting his legs): It doesn't matter. 'Cause I can't feel them. Are you ready?<br /><br />Jake: To take you to a hospital?-<br /><br />Amir: -To participate in my office obstacle course?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I don't want to do that man.<br /><br />Amir: Why, you're afraid you can't beat my time?<br /><br />Jake: No, I'm afraid I'm not gonna get any work done to-<br /><br /> What time? Time for what?<br /><br />Amir: My lap time. One lap around the office hurtling over chairs to the<br /><br />bathroom and back.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I'm not worried about that. What was the time, by the way?<br /><br />Amir: One minute and eight seconds<br /><br />[Jake is exasperated by Amir's antics.]<br /><br />Jake: That's a pretty bad idea and it's a bad time.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, well forget it.<br /><br />Jake: I could beat that time.<br /><br />Amir: I mean if you want I could set it up<br /><br />[Jake bolts and runs]<br /><br />Amir: -up and start...

Jake is on the floor after tripping on a chair. ]<br /><br />Amir: You didn't let me start my watch.<br /><br />Jake (defensively): Yeah it's called getting a head start.<br /><br />Amir: That's against the rules.<br /><br />Jake: It's against the rules to not tell me the rules before I start running. That's probably why I busted my shin dude.<br /><br />Amir: How does that have anything to do with your shin?<br /><br />Jake: I'm taking a minute off the final time I'm sorry. Alright you ready?<br /><br />Amir: No. You can't dock-<br /><br />Jake: Go!<br /><br />[Jake heads off running as Amir shakes his head. Jake runs a few feet and then turns around.]<br /><br />Jake: Whew. Time?<br /><br />Amir: That was - you didn't do any of it. You didn't hurdle over the chairs.<br /><br />You didn't run to the bathroom and back.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, that would've taken forever. What was my time?<br /><br />Amir: I guess like three seconds- four seconds <br /><br />Jake (calculating in his head): Alright, three seconds minus the minute that I'm docking...that's like negative fifty-two seconds... a new record.<br /><br />Amir (shaking his head): What a weird math.. No that's not right.<br /><br />Jake: I don't need math, dude. Not when I'm this athletic. Give me some ice though, my shin is starting to swell right the heck up.<br /><br />Amir (to camera): See the workplace doesn't have to be boring. Get together, make the day fun. What are some ways you spice up the work environment? Let us know by-<br /><br />Jake: Look man, give me the ice.

Mmm, fuck me in my goat ass. [To Jake] Another day at the races!<br /><br />Jake: Gotta stop saying that man, what happened to you?<br /><br />Amir: My snake frickin', clipped me or something.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, it looks like it did clip you.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah went right for the jugular too, smug prick. Got me once in the neck, twice in the forearm, and then like two more times in the abdomen.<br /><br />Jake: So not right in the jugular, right? Why were you fighting a snake?<br /><br />Amir: I didn't feed the prick for like, two weeks 'cause she was being a bitch. Then I decided to start taunting her, you know, dancing around with dead mice all over my body. Dumb ass went for it! And got it!<br /><br />Jake: Sounds like you're the prick and the bitch because you're starving a snake. You're also the dumbass because you're dancing around a hungry snake with mice all over your body.<br /><br />Amir: So you're saying I'm dumber than a snake?<br /><br />Jake: I wasn't saying that, but yeah, for the record I do think you're dumber than a snake.<br /><br />Amir: OK you should have been there man, Leron was dying!<br /><br />Jake: He was laughing at you?<br /><br />Amir: No he was legit dying, like he got bit by a snake last week but he was like too cool to go to the hospital....<br /><br />Jake: Was it a snake or your snake?<br /><br />Amir: It's my snake now because I liked her feistiness, OK? But it was a snake at the time. I thought I could tame the wild beast. Turns out.... I could!<br /><br />Jake: No it turns out you couldn't, cause remember it clipped you? This morning? Like six times?<br /><br />Amir: Mmhmm....<br /><br />Jake: OK you shouldn't own pets man, you can barely keep yourself alive.<br /><br />Amir: OK don't tell me I shouldn't own pets, I've had like, ten owls in the past year. <br /><br />Jake: What happened to them?<br /><br />Amir: They're frickin' dead! [Hoot] gives a shit?<br /><br />[Jake turns away and goes back to looking at his computer]<br /><br />Amir: Hoot.... gives a shit! Come on man!<br /><br />[Jake continues to ignore him]<br /><br />Amir: Just so you know, this silent treatment isn't winning! Haha! Ow! [No response from Jake] Come on man! That's gold, and you're not even cracking a smile!<br /><br />Jake: [Miming saying the words] I can't hear you.<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: [Still miming] Can't hear you.<br /><br />Amir: Oh my god.... I think I just turned deaf.<br /><br />[Jake mimes yelling]<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I can't.... [bangs on desk] I can only hear noises and me, but not you. [Clapping] Like, I can't even tell if I can even hear this or just feel it....<br /><br />Pat: Shut up!<br /><br />Amir: You shut up, OK? For the rest of my life all I can hear is noises, and you! Do you realize how doomed I am?<br /><br />Jake: [Out loud] You're not deaf!<br /><br />Amir: [Picking up open backpack with hissing snake inside] Haha, you hear that you little serpent slut? I'm not deaf!<br /><br />Jake: You keep it in your backpack?<br /><br />Amir: [holding on to snake, which is lunging and striking at him] Haha OK, whoa! Little bitch nicked me!<br /><br />",

So, we'll see you in a month, like... what?<br /><br />Karen: Well... uh, we still haven't firmed up any locations.<br /><br />Amir: I told you three months ago I was on it.<br /><br />Karen: I know, but the last time I emailed you for a status update, you sent me a video of a monkey who smells his hand and faints.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah. That's because he farted in it.<br /><br />Mark: [laughing]<br /><br />Amir: That's funny to you?!<br /><br />Mark: Isn't it supposed to be?<br /><br />Amir: Am I excused, like...?<br /><br />Jake: We haven't gotten anywhere yet.<br /><br />Karen: Last time we spoke, you said an elephant ride was doable, as a carnival for young kids.<br /><br />Amir: Right. And I stand by that.<br /><br />Mark: My brother-in-law and I have devised a way to steal large animals from circuses and zoos. If you're really certain about this, I can get you an elephant.<br /><br />Amir: Dead or alive?<br /><br />Jake: Alive! Alive, right? Don't do it. But if you do: Alive.<br /><br />Mark: I-I-I-I have to make a call. I'm not sure if I can make this alive thing happen.<br /><br />Karen: What about the mural?<br /><br />Amir: What ABOUT the mural, Kare?<br /><br />Jake: Will you please not snap at Karen?<br /><br />Karen: You said you had been able to procure--<br /><br />Amir: [interrupting] Yeah, a 200 foot by 10 foot concrete wall -- blank as the night -- ready to be painted by the imaginative fingers of today's youth.<br /><br />Karen: And?<br /><br />Amir: And... I was able to... get one twice as big.<br /><br />Karen: [gasping in surprise]<br /><br />Amir: So... double the kids... on that... Karen.<br /><br />Karen: They are going to be so happy!<br /><br />Jake: He just winked at me, but even if he didn't, I doubt he could have gotten a wall like that.<br /><br />Amir: NARC!<br /><br />Karen: Well, uh... what about snacks? People are going to be hungry.<br /><br />Mark: How does two tons of wet elephant meat sound?<br /><br />Jake: It doesn't sound good, Mark.<br /><br />Mark: I don't want to say how or why, but I have recently come into a surplus of elephant meat.<br /><br />Jake: We know how.<br /><br />Mark: I certainly can't eat all of it -- trust me on that!<br /><br />Amir: What about music, okay? Some phat beats, dope rhymes, things like--<br /><br />Jake: [interrupting] I'll take care of the music.<br /><br />Amir: I can freestyle for about two and half hours straight. Make your face leak underneath... all that stuff--<br /><br />Jake: [interrupting] You couldn't freestyle for like ten seconds just now--<br /><br />Amir: [interrupting] I'm going to get a CD! A frickin' mix cassette tape -- how does that sound for a freestyle?<br /><br />Jake: Those sound like two different things! I'll get a DJ, okay?<br /><br />Mark: Alright. Can we go?<br /><br />Amir: You can go... to jail! For killing and de-tusking an elephant. I mean, how long are we going to stand idly by--<br /><br />Mark: [interrupting and getting out of his chair to approach Amir] I didn't touch a single tusk!

You sound just like her dad.<br /><br />Jake: Whose dad?<br /><br />Amir: The girl that refused to go with me.<br /><br />Jake: You're a bad person.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, so me and my boys [Amir makes air quotes.] rented a limo (pronounced lie-mo). We're gonna go... stag. (chuckles)<br /><br />Jake: Why the air quotes?<br /><br />Amir: That's when you go alone, without a date, but—<br /><br />Jake: I know what stag is; you did air quotes over my boys.<br /><br />Amir: 'Cause none of those douches ponied up the dough yet, all right? And they all said no to me. It's like, I'm doing all the leg work; the least they could do is not yell at me.<br /><br />Jake: Gotcha, so it sounds like you're going to prom completely alone.<br /><br />Amir: Nah, I'm gonna go with Mickey, my friend. (chuckles) Goal of the prom is to pour a gallon of milk on the bitch that refused this hand.<br /><br />Jake: Why milk?<br /><br />Amir: (leaning in closer) Okay, get this, poetic justice...<br /><br />Jake: Don't whisper to me, okay? I don't wanna know your secrets.<br /><br />Amir: Couple of weeks ago, a few of her friends beat the shit out of me.<br /><br />Jake: So you got your ass kicked by a bunch of highschoolers.<br /><br />Amir: Not a bunch! Okay, just two sluts that wouldn't take Please, I'm sorry! for an answer. (chuckles) They pushed me into a cow. Dodged a bullet there...<br /><br />Jake: Okay, why the corsage?<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: The corsage?<br /><br />Amir: (grabs corsage) Okay, is there an answer I could give that wouldn't result in you hating me more?<br /><br />Jake: I guess you could say this corsage is for an unfortunate kid who couldn't afford a gift for his date, and the only reason I'm in a tuxedo is because I rented a limo and I'm gonna take them to prom myself.<br /><br />Amir: (pause, quiet, shaking head) ...No.<br /><br />Jake: I didn't think so.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, it's, like, not even close to that...<br /><br />Jake: I know.<br /><br />Amir: I was gonna put this corsage on her milk-soaked wrist and plug away at her fingers like they're little udders, while the whole school hopefully chants, Moo, cow, moo! Moo, cow, moo! Moo, cow, moo!<br /><br />Jake: All right, dinner tonight?<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: Just you and me, dinner... skip the prom.<br /><br />Amir: (pause) Okay.<br /><br />Jake: All right, great!<br /><br />Amir: ...I just have to, like, swing by for, like, [Jake: No!] twenty seconds, [Jake: I'm saying... We'll skip it!] to go into the prom for, like, a little bit! [Jake: It—no, why?] We're gonna go [Jake: Why?] for half a second! [Jake: Why? I said!] To pour a gallon of milk on the bitch; I still wanna do that!<br /><br />Jake: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid.<br /><br />Amir: It's too late, okay; I already have the whole thing pretty much planned out.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, well, if it's only planned out pretty much, then it's not too late.<br /><br />Amir: (grabbing cell phone) Oh! Speak of the devil! (talking on phone) Hey bitch! (chuckles) Hey, I hope you're not lactose intolerant—'cause you're getting milked tonight! (chuckles) Good! No, good, put him on. (talking to dad) Hey sir. Hi, yes, uh, your daughter is a nobody at high school. I'm friends with Dylan, okay? I know what's cool. He wears frickin' sunglasses to class. Yeah! No, I'm in the cool group, and we all agree that your daughter is a zero. She's less than a zero, and guess what? She's gonna wake up with cheese in her ears tomorrow morning, which ain't gonna help the situation. (chuckles) Y'know what, good, call the cops. I just won't show up then. (chuckles) Actually... can you not, because I wanted to show up and do the milk—well, I don't wanna get arrested! So now I can't go—I dropped a G on this frickin' tux, sir! This was supposed to be the most magical night of my life, and you're basically telling me not—that I can't go, because I'm—okay. Great. Bye. (hangs up) Yeah, my night just opened up hard, so we can hang out. I might wanna call in a bomb threat though, y'know; if the fuzz are gonna be there, we might as well frickin' make them earn their keep.<br /><br />Amir: (talking on phone) Ah, Mickey, my friend! (laughs) Good news, sir! There was no traffic, and I am there early! Come outside. That body you're about to see hanging out of a stretch Hummerzine? That is me, my friend! That is all me. (laughs) Can you see me? I'm waving my hands, Mickey! Nah, you can't see me, because I'm not there, Mickey. I got stood up to prom, Mickey, and now you are too! Yeah, Operash Milk? That's a no-go. I don't c—I don't know, man; you spent two weeks on a dairy farm. (laughing) That's not my problem anymore! That's your milk, your problem, Mickey! The operash is a no-go like I said, Mickey.

It's a moment and then it's a second and as soon as you identify it it's over. So... 'Cause you can look at the sun (simultaneously) and you can say-<br /><br />JAKE: (simultaneously) This is really nice.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm saying it's really nice.<br /><br />AMIR: I know and I'm just saying not to take today for granted. <br /><br />JAKE: I won't.<br /><br />AMIR: 'Cause if you do (simultaneously) then it's just gonna slip awa- okay.<br /><br />JAKE: (simultaneously) Well I said I wan't going to.

Just don't steal it from me.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not stealing it. (simultaneously) Agreed.

Okay, I really wanna take a picture (simultaneously) then post it online, otherwise it doesn't exist. No, gimme!

What'd you think?<br /><br />JAKE: Sounds like you still want to be talking then.<br /><br />AMIR: What did you think?<br /><br />JAKE: That you shouldn't write screenplays anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: Give me one thing, okay? Give me one thing to hone in on. It's so broad.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not going to give you one thing. You always want one thing.There are thousands of screenplay rules, right? And I can't imagine one of them that you didn't break.<br /><br />AMIR: Just try to focus all your energy, like a laser, on one thing, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop saying like you want one thing, like you only could've made one mistake. You made a lot of mistakes.<br /><br />AMIR: Focus it. Focus in on one.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, the first mistake you could've made: your title is F*ck It: I'm Going Fishing Instead.<br /><br />AMIR: Wow! Congrats, grad! You can read.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't get defensive so early, okay? I mean, I read the whole thing, didn't I? And page 96 to 311 is one long, unbroken run-on sentence about how your main character, Brake Obama - a name I assume you spelled incorrectly-<br /><br />AMIR: -Probably autocorrected...<br /><br />JAKE: I doubt it. About how Brake Obama either needs to show his birth certificate or resign as mayor.<br /><br />AMIR: That impostor is from Hawaii, I guarantee it.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, that's true.<br /><br />AMIR: Maybe you'll be singing a different tune when you realize who we were thinking of for the male lead.<br /><br />JAKE: Another thing: all of your scene headings say Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: Edward frickin' Nort.<br /><br />JAKE: Norton.<br /><br />AMIR: No, my cousin's lawyer, Edward Nort.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I don't even think you need an actor because there's only one line of dialogue. It comes on page 299, and I think it's a typo because the main character says, Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: You should've heard Mr. Nort deliver that line. He nailed it in callbacks.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, how about this: I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.<br /><br />AMIR: So basically, you're jealous 'cause we didn't cast you as the main guy.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, I'm not jealous, alright? I don't give a shit.<br /><br />AMIR: You're not annoyed we went with Nort over you?<br /><br />JAKE: I would've loved at least an opportunity to make callbacks, to know I was seriously considered.<br /><br />AMIR: You were seriously considered. You were!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, bullshit!<br /><br />AMIR: Yes!<br /><br />JAKE: You dragged my ass in there as a dog and pony show, alright? You had Nort and I from day one and you put in there to light a fire under Nort's agent's ass. Well guess what? (gets serious) Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck-<br /><br />AMIR: -Bad!<br /><br />JAKE: That was not bad! That was good! Nort's bad. Here we go, southern twang!

I laugh at all your jokes, and trust me: they are not all winners.<br /><br />[Jake is holding his throat, and still having trouble breathing.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, what is this? [Amir copies the gesture Jake is making.] I never studied the universal symbols for stuff.<br /><br />[Jake tries to respond, but can't.]<br /><br />AMIR: How 'bout this: If you're really choking, spin around in your chair.<br /><br />[Jake frantically spins around, then looks at Amir intently.]<br /><br />AMIR: Nahhh. Not buying that! Not buying that at all. That's a fake spin; you're just spinning to make it seem like you're choking because I told you to spin.<br /><br />[David comes in.]<br /><br />DAVID: Jake's choking!<br /><br />AMIR: No no, this is just a game we're playing, okay? And you're not invited. So leave.<br /><br />[As David leaves, Jake claws at the air in an attempt to get his attention.]<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry, it's just that if this isn't a goof, it should be me that saves you, not some... other loser, alright? Amir saves Jake. That's... that's the lead.<br /><br />[Jake falls out of his chair. He slumps to the floor and stops moving entirely. Amir just shakes his head. Then Amir slides Jake's sandwich toward himself.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna eat your sandwich... so if you're alive... better stop me...<br /><br />[Jake lies motionless on the floor. Amir begins eating his sandwich.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay... great acting job. The best Actor... -Grammy... goes to... you!

Wow... you know, I gotta hand it to you, man... didn't think you'd take it this far! Hm. Aah!<br /><br />[Amir throws the bread from the sandwich at Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Now I wish you are alive, because if you're dead, people are gonna blame me... and you're gonna feel... like a pony. [pause] Okay! This has been a dope lunch, thank you, but I don't deserve this star-treatment. So.<br /><br />[Amir leaves Jake alone. Jake lies motionless on the floor.

Are you guys laughing 'cause you're about to get fired?<br /><br />JAKE: Why would we be laughing if that were the case?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, why'd you cut out at 3:30 to go get ice cream?<br /><br />JAKE: There's an ice cream truck downstairs. We were gone for like, fifteen minutes.<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, actually, my dear Watson, it was twelve.<br /><br />JAKE: So it was less than I thought. It's the first nice day of the year and - No! No. I don't have to justify this to you.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you don't have to justify it to me. You do have to justify it to your boss, though. (points to his computer) Don't you?<br /><br />JAKE: (looking at Amir's computer) What are these?<br /><br />AMIR: Thirty three emails sent from your account to Ricky, your boss. Shame you weren't here to stop me. Oh wait, I forgot. You're in a corn maze!<br /><br />JAKE: You actually did forget; we were getting ice cream. (reading email) Dear Ricky, I don't value my job as much as I do that sweet, sweet cream.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, and then he responds as the Donald, Ya fired.<br /><br />JAKE: No, he didn't respond. You emailed him again, and you said, Do you want your letter of resignation in a waffle cone or a waffle bowl, sir? Or is it easier if I just blend it up in a soy vanilla frappuccino?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, cream on the side.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't write that.<br /><br />AMIR: And mixed in.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't write that.<br /><br />AMIR: I just thought of it two seconds ago. Otherwise I would've written it. But now, Ricky gets the hit and he's livid.<br /><br />JAKE: No, that's when you finally got his auto-response. He's on vacation for the week, and you responded to that, What a quinky-doink, I'm also on vacation as I've mentally checked the f*ck out twelve minutes ago and went deep in that cream, cream county, and you know what? It is sweet. It tastes like never working in this town again.<br /><br />AMIR: For a thousand Gs, I will un-send that email.<br /><br />JAKE: You can't do that. It looks like you started back-tracking anyways, 'cause this email reads: Sir, forgive me for getting ice cream, I value this job.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, keep reading. It gets brat-worse.<br /><br />JAKE: No, it doesn't, it looks like you come clean in the next email; you write, You've just been had, this was an Amir Blumenfeld prank-duction. You shoulda seen the look on your face.<br /><br />AMIR: You looked like a friggin dildo baggins!<br /><br />JAKE: You didn't write that.<br /><br />AMIR: I just thought of it! Everything that I'm saying now, I just thought of so it's not in the emails.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, well I'm just saying you didn't add it. Okay, well you went on; you said, Please, please, please open up Photobooth and take a picture of your mug right now and send it to me, and I wanna see what a legit dildo baggins you must look alike, sir.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, are we done here?<br /><br />JAKE: So it looks like you didn't just think of the dildo baggins-<br /><br />AMIR: (raising voice) Are we done here?<br /><br />JAKE: Where are you going?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm cutting out early, okay? It's the first nice day of the year, and you expect me to spend it indoors? No! I'm going home!<br /><br />JAKE: So it sounds like you're still going to be indoors.<br /><br />AMIR: (takes a bite of a co-worker's ice cream) Woo! Lactose intolerant since '94 baby!

You can't torture me like that man! You can't torture me like that! You're making me weak kid. You're making me weak man. (Goat like giggling between each sentence) I'm not eating carbs this month man and it's killing me to watch you eat that sandwich.<br /><br />Jake: Stop it with that voice. You know you're eating a sandwich right now, that has carbs. (Cut to Amir eating sandwich)<br /><br />Amir: (Mouth full of sandwich) Not a lot. Not a lot!<br /><br />Jake: Yeah a lot and you said you weren't eating any.<br /><br />Amir: Okay well I'm hungry! Alright? And I need the energy and I'm eating around the carbs.<br /><br />Jake: You're not eating around the carbs, you're eating a foot-long sub and it looks like it has french fries in it.<br /><br />Amir: (Now holding a half eaten bagel) You want some legit constructive criticism? <br /><br />Jake: How do you have a bagel now?<br /><br />Amir: You're not well travelled. (Shrugs) Bomb-shell. I know I'm sorry but I'm right okay. Take yourself on a me-cation. Go some place warm.<br /><br />Jake: It's 90 degrees out today.<br /><br />Amir: (Biting a pizza slice) Then go some place warmer.<br /><br />Jake: You're eating so many carbs. Like everything you're putting into your mouth is a carb.<br /><br />Amir: I'm on a diet. Okay. Have you ever heard of Atkins?<br /><br />Jake: I have. I don't think you have. Cos you're not doing it right.<br /><br />Amir: (Drops pizza on paper plate) I eat what I want, when I want, why... I want.<br /><br />Jake: That's not how any diet works alright? Especially Atkins.<br /><br />Amir: Why don't you tell my six pack how diets work baby! (Lifts up shirt)<br /><br />Jake: Oh wow, lot of rashes!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: Wow.<br /><br />Amir: I know!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ<br /><br />Amir: Shut up!<br /><br />Jake: So many rashes...<br /><br />Amir: Okay relax. It's all one big rash okay. This one's a rash, that one's eczema all along my sides that's adult impetigo.<br /><br />Jake: So that sounds like a lot of different rashes.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, each rash is a sixer. A six pack of ab muscles so...<br /><br />Jake: Look now you're binge eating man!<br /><br />Amir: (Eating spaghetti bolognese) Okay I eat when I'm happy! <br /><br />Jake: Well you look really upset.<br /><br />Amir: (Whining through mouthful of spag bol) That's cos my frickin abdomen feels like it was drenched in syrup two weeks ago and I haven't had the time to clean it off since. It's really dry and really itchy.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah well maybe you're allergic to some of the food that you're eating, ok.<br /><br />Amir: No, it's not that. It's from the syrup. I actually did drench my abdomen in syrup.<br /><br />Jake: So that wasn't a metaphor.<br /><br />Amir. No. It was for real. I legit just arched my back and walked abdomen-first into a syrup fall, which is kinda like a waterfall but instead of water it's...<br /><br />Jake: Syrup (nodding)<br /><br />Amir: GRAVY! Okay! Don't cut me off.<br /><br />Sarah: Yeah you do do that Jake. You cut people off like, a lot. It's really...<br /><br />Jake: Annoying! I know!

And she had a lazy eye, which you don't.<br /><br />Jake: She did! Yes, it was like all over there! (pointing)<br /><br />Amir: She was always like—Where is she look—She could watch two TVs at once.

Osama bin Not.<br /><br />Sarah: He was hiding.<br /><br />Amir: Well now he's not. We're gonna put him on trial, and I'm gonna grill him. (sizzling noise) George Foreman style.

Put a net around him and dragged his ass to Yankees Stadium, put him on trial in front of the fearless fans of Bronx's Alpha, parked his car in the Harvard yard, took him to the square.<br /><br />Jake: That's Boston.<br /><br />Amir: Only it wasn't Osama bin Laden; it was my dad. And it wasn't Yankees Stadium, either, it was like my elementary school and I was naked.<br /><br />Jake: Ok, so now you're talking about like a dream you had, did you pass out or something?<br /><br />Amir: Mhm. Yeah I fainted, twice. Today, actually. Once at my aunt's condo on the way over here in a bowl of cereal, and another on like a subway platform, and when I came to there were 35 police officers looking down on me, told me I missed the train by like half an inch. I was this close-<br /><br />Jake: Alright, stop talking. You're saying, like a million different things at once and the only person who can juggle that many things at once is named yours truly. <br /><br />Jake: Alright leave! Everybody just leave, leave, alright? I'll make a video of me juggling, but for now; screw you guys, you need to go home. Alright, Murph, you're lucky you're a bitch, that would've hit you square. You got your bitch shield up, dude.<br /><br />Jake (Murph is wrestling him): Ow! Alright. Ow! Ah! Ah! Ow! Murph! I was joking!<br /><br />",

Oh right I remember where you were, 100%, firmly placed, inside of, my snatch.<br /><br />Jake: Stop saying snatch.

I mean, is it?<br /><br />Jake: Okay well, yeah, well I guess you spend a lot of time in New Jersey on the weekends.<br /><br />Amir: Sometimes I spend gas station time there, but like nothing more than that.<br /><br />Jake: Okay, well I'm going to know if you posted my number if I answer this and it's somebody that I don't know asking me what I'm <br /><br />wearing.<br /><br />Amir: Which is why I swear to god that I didn't leave your phone number.<br /><br />Jake: (Talking on the phone) Hello?

It's a deluxe package, that's the MacBook Air, the wine, you know, two days in the ring with a former pro, plus the plane tickets to España, so, it's a little bit much, but like, when he gets back we're going to have to divide up the receipts, see how much the food and wine cost, because that was not included.

And no I didn't get into his Egg Box cause I think you welded it shut with that little torch of yours.<br /><br />Rick Fox: (holds up and lights torch) I was trying to break the lock.<br /><br />Amir: (frustrated) I know; and I was trying to tell you that it wasn't locked.<br /><br />Rick Fox: Look, in that box right there is where Jake keeps eggs.<br /><br />Amir: (growing more irritated) Why do you think that!?

Ok, you're starting to freak me out. Do you remember like five minutes ago you tied up Jake and locked him in the supply closet?

And then you're like oh the NBA's locked out this season (Rick Fox plays the world's smallest violin), so all those bets are an instant loss!<br /><br />Rick Fox: Yeah, instant loss.<br /><br />Amir: By the way, there might not be any eggs in here, ok; let alone, I think you said, all the eggs in the world.

Don't feel like you have to fill every silence with your stupid voice just because--<br /><br />Jake: Okay, don't just repeat things that I say. It makes sense when I say them to you.<br /><br />Amir: Then we agree...to disagree...about agreeing. Oh!<br /><br />Jake: Kickstarter is meant for like meaningful projects, like albums or films. <br /><br />Amir: I know.<br /><br />Jake: You know that? <br /><br />Amir: Yeah. <br /><br />Jake: So you think the Amir Blumenfeld Foundation For Not Giving A Shit is a meaningful project? <br /><br />Amir: It's..an album. And it's a film. <br /><br />Jake: No, it's not. Do you really expect people to donate?<br /><br />Amir: When you ask like that, definitely, okay? Besides, we give little bonuses to incentivize donations. <br /><br />Jake: I do see that--five dollars and you get a pin that says I'm Cheap James, bitch. <br /><br />Amir: If you're not cracking up right now, you've never seen the Chapel Show, okay?

It's people like you that ruin Kickstarter for real artists like me...and other people. <br /><br />Amir: You're a real artist?<br /><br />Jake: Good question.

What?<br /><br />(Amir and Jake are inside a coffee shop about to approach the counter)<br /><br />AMIR: It says employees must wash hands, OK? Employees. Last time I checked, I don't work here. <br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I'm just saying it's a common courtesy and it's like hygienic so you should really do it.<br /><br />AMIR: (to barista) Hey, I will have two Jack and diets and what do you want? <br /><br />JAKE: Nothing. You know, I'm going to go home--<br /><br />AMIR: (gibberish over Jake) I'll have two Jack and diets, a vodka cran and what do you want?<br /><br />JAKE: Chill out, OK? <br /><br />BARISTA: We don't serve alcohol.<br /><br />AMIR: What is this? Prohibition? OK, just give me a shot, you bitch. <br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Hey, wow, really quick to start offending people, right? Sorry, especially because you didn't even ask for a shot to begin with. <br /><br />AMIR: OK, get this. I walked in here with an itty-bitty waist and a round thing in my face, OK? And you know I got sprung, so I wanted to pull up tight and--<br /><br />JAKE: (to barista) Sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: --I noticed that, what?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm just going to have an iced coffee. Thank you. <br /><br />BARISTA: Sure. <br /><br />AMIR: By the way, the girl before us got two shots. Two. Don't think I didn't notice that.  <br /><br />JAKE: OK, she got two shots of espresso. <br /><br />AMIR: OK. Whatever. I'll take it. Anything to take the edge off. <br /><br />JAKE: That's definitely going to put the edge on. You know, what are you even stressed about? <br /><br />AMIR: Taxes. <br /><br />JAKE: Do you owe them? <br /><br />AMIR: No, I just found out about them and it's kind of stressing me out.  Do you guys know what's up? OK, Uncle Sam doesn't even put lube on before he fucks us--<br /><br />BARISTA: So, you want two shots of espresso, one ice coffee. Do you want room?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, please.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll take that too. Actually make mine a room with coke. It's got to be 9AM somewhere. <br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, it's 9AM here.<br /><br />AMIR: It's nickel beer night.<br /><br />BARISTA: We don't serve beer.  <br /><br />AMIR: Will you be my girlfriend?<br /><br />BARISTA: Sorry guys, I have other customers.<br /><br />AMIR: OK, you know what? We can pay with cash, credit or break dancing. <br /><br />BARISTA: We're cash only. <br /><br />JAKE: He's going to break dance. <br /><br />AMIR: (hopping about) Here we go. (throws himself on floor, change clattering everywhere, trying his best to 'break dance')<br /><br />JAKE: (to barista, as Amir is still on the floor) Can I have your number?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh. (popping up by Jake again, holding neck) Ahh, OK, hey. Cash is fine, unless you like that.<br /><br />BARISTA: Cash is fine. <br /><br />AMIR: (to Jake) Do you have five dollars? <br /><br />THE END.  <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFYx5GTTElA<br /><br />",

Think about that. What would you rather do? You're in a , okay you're in a board room, right? Everybody's sitting. You gotta stand. You're in a funeral. Everybody standing you gotta sit. Which one would you rather do?<br /><br />Jake: Stand.<br /><br />Amir: Hah! Stand when everyone's sitting? Why is that? (laughs)<br /><br />Jake: I have no idea..<br /><br />Amir: Yeah I'd rather sit when everyone' s standing because you know what, at the very least I'm comfortable. I'm the one who's getting comfortable - (Jake stands up and leaves) Oh, You're playing the game right now, you're standing when I'm sitting! You know what? Let's play along - I'll sit and you stand.

Is everybody... occasionally wearing deodorant, maybe?<br /><br />[AMIR: ======))~~~~~]<br /><br />[AMIR: ======= )~~~~~]<br /><br />[AMIR: (That's a dick.)]<br /><br />[AMIR: LOOK at ME]<br /><br />[AMIR: LOOOK AT MEEEE!!!!!]<br /><br />PAUL:I mean, I think that would probably be a good idea...<br /><br />[Jake gives in and looks at Amir. Amir makes a goofy face with his tongue sticking out, and farts as he makes it.]<br /><br />PAUL: ...um, so it's really not clear to me why we can't act like adults, because... this is a professional place of business, we have a lot of visitors who come in...<br /><br />[JAKE: You just farted.]<br /><br />[AMIR: I made a face :)]<br /><br />[AMIR: :)]<br /><br />PAUL: ...and, a lot of them are repelled--<br /><br />[JAKE: I saw your face. You also farted. People noticed.]<br /><br />PAUL: Uh, Jake. Could you put that phone away, please? Thank you.<br /><br />[Jake tucks his phone away. Amir smirks.]<br /><br />PAUL: We actually had... an ad sales client in here last week...<br /><br />[Amir immediately begins texting Jake again.]<br /><br />PAUL: ...who was saying that they would love to spend four million dollars with us, but they couldn't, because... they were actually vomiting in the bathroom because the smell was so bad.<br /><br />[AMIR: This relationship isn't working out. Congrats.]<br /><br />[AMIR: Congrats. You just ruined this. Look at me. Because its over.]<br /><br />[AMIR: Text me back or I'm gonna call you out for being a bitch.]<br /><br />[Jake ignores Amir's texts.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake's a bitch.<br /><br />[The room goes silent.]<br /><br />MURPH: Ha!<br /><br />[Jenny turns to look at Murph.]<br /><br />MURPH: [whispering] He's a bitch.<br /><br />PAUL: So, we're really trying to figure out... how we can make this better...<br /><br />[JAKE: Please stop texting me.]<br /><br />[AMIR: Congrats. You just made a fool of me.]<br /><br />...because... we can't continue to do this. It's-- it's a professional place of business, the whole side of the office is just-- just horrendous...<br /><br />[JAKE: Wow stop saying congrats.]<br /><br />PAUL ...this... horrible, horrible stench that's coming from over there, and, so... y'know-- I don't know if somebody's over there... going to the bathroom, and... not taking care of things properly...<br /><br />[Amir points the camera of his phone into his pants, takes a picture of his penis, and texts it to Jake twice.]<br /><br />[AMIR: That is for you to suck on.]<br /><br />[JAKE: Sent that twice]<br /><br />[AMIR: Suck on it.]<br /><br />PAUL: ...or... if there's... some other problem that we need to address, but, clearly this is something that can't continue--<br /><br />[JAKE: And I'm reporting you to hr now. For real]<br /><br />PAUL: Jake. I'm not going to ask you again.<br /><br />[Jake puts the phone down.]<br /><br />PAUL: Thank you. ...So as I was saying...<br /><br />[Amir begins texting Jake again.]<br /><br />PAUL: ...um, I want whoever it is to, kind of, look himself or herself in the eye, make sure that... you're really thinking about your co-workers.<br /><br />[AMIR: SPANKED!!!!!!!!!!!!]<br /><br />[JAKE: Stop dude]<br /><br />[AMIR: Epic SPANK!!!!!]<br /><br />PAUL: Because...It's very selfish. It's very unfair, to... create this kind of work environment.<br /><br />[JAKE: This is harassment]<br /><br />[AMIR: YOU GOT SPANKED]<br /><br />[Amir takes another picture of his penis, and sends it to Jake.]<br /><br />PAUL: I mean, the smell is so bad, it's-- it's just... unconsciona--<br /><br />[AMIR: That is my dicks sorry face. As in SORRY you got SPANKED!!!!!]<br /><br />PAUL: Jake... leave.<br /><br />JAKE: I wasn't texting...<br /><br />AMIR: Get out, bitch.<br /><br />[Jake gets up to leave.]<br /><br />PAUL: Oh, and Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />PAUL: Thanks.<br /><br />JAKE: For what?<br /><br />PAUL: Bein' a bitch.

Jake's a bitch!<br /><br />[Jake leaves.]<br /><br />MURPH: Get out, bitch!<br /><br />[The room falls silent, and people stare at Murph.]<br /><br />MURPH: He's a bitch!<br /><br />END<br /><br />",

Danger of missing that cupcake! (laughs)<br /><br />JAKE: You swore on your father's life that you just witnessed a double murder. You were hiding in a garbage can because you saw two Puerto Rican deli workers get hacked to bits? Your voice mail ended with you saying I think they see me and then six minutes of screaming.<br /><br />AMIR: How'd you like to be famous on YouTube?<br /><br />JAKE: I wouldn't.<br /><br />AMIR: Bull spit. Hey, that's my friend Basilio, okay? He's a professional parkour-doer-guy-thing.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound like the correct name for that, right?<br /><br />(Basilio does a flip)<br /><br />AMIR: Ahhhhh!

Why did you invite me here?<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, you think that's good?<br /><br />JAKE: I guess.<br /><br />AMIR: Read it and weep!<br /><br />JAKE: Read what?<br /><br />AMIR: (hands Jake the camera) Hold that. (Amir tries to do a flip, runs into the wall, and falls on the ground) Oh ganked that! False start, unless, did I stick it? I didn't get a good vantage point of it.<br /><br />JAKE: Did you feel like you ran up the wall and did a back flip?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, maybe. It just... Basilio says that you lose yourself in the zone, right? You get into like this zone and you just sort of can't really tell what's going on anymore, so maybe I stuck it and I just wasn't aware.<br /><br />JAKE: He hits a zone, you hit the wall.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I think I did it. I think I stuck the landing too, which is the hardest part, right B?<br /><br />JAKE: Your first reaction was to say Ah, ganked that. Do you think that was a good thing?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a great thing in parkour, it's a great thing to say that.<br /><br />BASILIO: It's not.<br /><br />AMIR: What do you know, man, okay? You don't know jack. It is!<br /><br />JAKE: He's the professional, and he says it's not.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well he's a little bitch that knows less about parkour than you do! (groans with pain)<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, don't do that. He's obviously being nice and trying to teach you.<br /><br />BASILIO: I wasn't teaching him anything; he's been following me around with his video camera for three hours!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, freestyle walking is all about self expression!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow! Oh my God, your arm is dislocated bad.<br /><br />(Amir's arm is bent all the way backwards)<br /><br />AMIR: Small price to pay for landing it square.

It was perfect!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: You gotta be kidding me with this! It was perfect! Unhh!<br /><br />Jake: What are you talking about?<br /><br />Amir: Facebook just jumped the shark. Okay, they had a perfect game going and they overdid it! Okay, trust me, I follow a lot of design Tumblrs, so I know when I see things that are overdone, and they overdid it.<br /><br />Jake: What's wrong with it?<br /><br />Amir: It's different. Which means it's bad. Which means I'm pissed. Okay, the big three.<br /><br />Jake: Those all sound like one thing.<br /><br />Amir: No, I've kept quiet till now, but I'm gonna make a Facebook group about it.<br /><br />Jake: You didn't keep quiet at all! You found out about it 10 seconds ago and you were yelling about it ever since. And looking at your Facebook profile, it looks like, wow, yeah, you've protested every single Facebook redesign!<br /><br />Amir: I deleted those groups!<br /><br />Jake: First of all, you didn't. Second of all, that doesn't change my point. Look at this first group, okay? Four years ago: Ten thousand strong against the Facebook newsfeed—<br /><br />Amir: Newsfeed, yeah.<br /><br />Jake: Facebook was flawless and now it's garbage. They had a perfect game going.<br /><br />Amir: It was garbage. Yeah, they jumped the shark.<br /><br />Jake: Fine. Six months later you wrote, Holy carp, why change perfection? Facebook is without flaw, but new design change makes it official: they just jumped the shark. A hundred thousand strong against this Obamanation.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, that group was partly political.<br /><br />Jake: Right.<br /><br />Amir: And guess what? It filled up.<br /><br />Jake: No it didn't. No members—you're not even a member! Jesus Christ! Next one: Delete the Facebook Graffiti Wall. It's a joke and a fool. Two weeks later: One million strong to bring back Graffiti Wall. I know I abused it, but I miss it.<br /><br />Amir: Straight up, they jumped the carp, when they lost the Graffiti Wall. Like...<br /><br />Jake: Lemme ask you a question: do you notice a pattern?<br /><br />Amir: [In a whiny and very high-pitched voice] Yeah, Facebook jumps the frickin' shark, okay? Every time they have a perfect game going and they fricking sell out! They jump the carp!<br /><br />Jake: Oh my god, your voice is painful! Look, here's another thing man: every single week you try to start a national Deactivate Facebook Day. Like, here's one that says Zark Fuckerberg is gonna start charging for Facebook. Please read now and delete your account.<br /><br />Amir: He started. He started charging, seven bucks a pop.<br /><br />Jake: No he didn't!<br /><br />Amir: He didn't, because enough people joined the group!<br /><br />Jake: You just lied, then, cause you said he did start charging.<br /><br />Amir: Oh my god, the facts are in on Twitter: Facebook was perfect but they just made it Myspace! NO!<br /><br />Jake: You know you said that two years ago: Ten million strong against the new Facebook, cause they just made it Myspace.<br /><br />Amir: [Crying] Yeah, cause it sucked!<br /><br />Jake: Oh my god, stop crying! You just said it was perfect. The same version you hated two years ago, you just called it perfect.<br /><br />Amir: Garbage becomes perfect over time as you get used to the garbage and forget what made it so bad. Like, you don't get the Internet and commenting in general, so it's not even worth saying—<br /><br />Jake: By the way, have you been to Myspace recently? It's just a music video website. There's no profiles or anything.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, you know why?<br /><br />Jake: Cause they jumped the shark—<br /><br />Amir: Cause they jumped the car—the, yeah—the shark, exactly right.<br /><br />Original Location<br /><br />Spare me your change.<br /><br />",

Cause it's working.<br /><br />Jake: I'm just saying it was nice to see my family, it was fun to hang out with my friends from high school...<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, I wasn't home for but two minutes before the old man offers me a grilled jizz sandwich.  Curious, I say yes, and he chucks a cast iron skillet at the back of my face.<br /><br />Jake: The back of your face?<br /><br />Amir: The back of my fricken' face!  Yeah, hit me square and crack goes my weasel.<br /><br />Jake: Hey! Don't ruin my day with this sad sad story...uncross the eyes, there it is.<br /><br />Amir: So I say nope not this year, not again, I'm better than this, and I book it like a librarian as my dad threatens to move.  Only problem is, Uh oh, mommy's lying supine underneath my back tires threatening to sue me if I run over her head like a fricken' coconut.<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ...<br /><br />Amir: My Hanukkah wish, didn't come true cause my old man is just pushin' the hood of the car beggin' to the only god he knows to run the bitch over and I'm ridin' shotgun with my hand on the E-brake while the old maid is in the back fricken' planking underneath my back tires, kissing the pavement, begging me to fucking run her over too.  I'm crying like a coward up there right, screaming It's a set-up, it's a set-up!<br /><br />Jake: Why did you even go home?!<br /><br />Amir: I was asking myself the same question when my dad popped a squat on the windshield of my rented Kia Sorento and tried to drop a deuce.<br /><br />Jake: Tried?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! Tried.  Turns out he didn't have to go and the only thing he could muster was a little bit of pee and a shart roughly the size of a dead tadpole.  Looked like a mud-covered slug and stank like a pug.  So I flip on the old windshield wipers, throw the Sorento into drive and crash through my parents garage.  Flip a U-bang and I start humming to myself ♪Silent Night♪.  Only problem is I'm sad as hell.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, I would be too.<br /><br />Amir: But I figure hey, 'tis the season who doesn't love a second chance so I swing by the mall and buy my dad a two thousand dollar watch.  Yeah, a gold roly-poly for that oldy-trolly.<br /><br />Jake: Oh no...<br /><br />Amir: Oh no is...wrong!  Yeah, turns out gold isn't his color because when I get home the entire house is gutted, empty, and there's a note on what's left of the door that says here died a happy family, RIP, thanks to you, Amir.  Can you believe that?  Callin' me out like that?  Rawdoggin' me in front of my girl.<br /><br />Jake: So oh no was right, by the way, and, what girl?<br /><br />Amir: Oh that's another thing.  I brought home a Thai whore just to show my dad that I had a mate in life.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you want his affection?  It sounds like he's a terrible person.<br /><br />Amir: He means well.<br /><br />Jake: No, he doesn't.  How could he possibly mean well?<br /><br />Amir: How's this for a happy ending?  New Years Eve Eve, December 39th.<br /><br />Jake: Wrong.<br /><br />Amir: I get a call from a jail in Fresno saying that they locked my old man up and threw away the key.  I'm alone, not doing anything anyway so I toss on a wig and hoof it down to the 'No to bail his ass out.  He pretends he doesn't even recognize me, his only daughter!<br /><br />Jake: You haven't been right about any of the things you've said, well, ever.<br /><br />Amir: I spend another 15K trying to bail him out of that Alabam Slamma' and he tells the bailiff he'd rather rot in hell than owe that son of a bitch coward, me, a fricken' dime.  Wanna know the icing on the cake?<br /><br />Jake: Not really.<br /><br />Amir: Me and my dad made up and he's coming to live with me in NYC, the big crapple.<br /><br />Jake: That sounds like the worst idea ever.<br /><br />Amir: I thought so too, but he promised to make me a grilled jizz on day one.<br /><br />Jake: Isn't that just when he knocks you out with a...<br /><br />Amir: Cast iron skillet, yeah, right to the back of my fricken' face.  But at least I have a dad.<br /><br />Jake: I have a dad.<br /><br />Amir: I'm talking about Pat.<br /><br />Pat: You monster!<br /><br />",

Isn't that what you said?<br /><br />JAKE: Because I'm upset that you showed up to work four hours late and you're wearing a skirt and you're trying to act like it's normal.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm a Brownie, okay, you can either deal with it or not.<br /><br />JAKE: I guess not.<br /><br />AMIR: Deal with it.<br /><br />JAKE: So I don't have that second option.<br /><br />AMIR: Options are for closers, alright. I gotta move a hundred and fifty boxes of Thin Mints and it tastes like chocolate-covered toothpaste, but a Brownie's gotta do what a Brownie's gotta do. And guess what? This Brownie? She's gotta do.<br /><br />JAKE: Nice.<br /><br />AMIR: Do you mean that?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you're definitely not a Brownie, because I think if you tried to sign up they would arrest you for being a pedophile.<br /><br />AMIR: Read the sash.<br /><br />JAKE: You're not wearing a sash.<br /><br />AMIR: I have more patches than a frickin' rodeo, man.<br /><br />JAKE: Do they have patches there?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, probably!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, there's your badge for not giving a shit.<br /><br />[Amir points to badge confidently]<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound official.<br /><br />AMIR: I officially don't care.<br /><br />JAKE: That pin says \"Most Bitchly!\"<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! Yeah, it does, okay? But it's a reminder for me to not be such a bitchly! I'm a little ashamed about it but I keep it on!<br /><br />JAKE: Listen to your voice.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't let it get to that octave.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm keeping it-<br /><br />JAKE: [voice gradually getting higher] Don't let it get up here!<br /><br />AMIR: To me, I'm like, always here, but every once in a while you just say \"Oh, stop with that voice.\"<br /><br />JAKE: You get really excited and start talking really fast like-<br /><br />AMIR: [in a high voice] No that's not even-<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, yeah yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: You just did it.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm starting to hear it a little bit.<br /><br />JAKE: What's the game plan here?

Shit. Uhh, yeah. I went for it, didn't get it. That's... that's gonna happen. Dane Cook even tells jokes that sometimes don't get laughs. That doesn't mean shit. That feeling never gets old...<br /><br />[Jake gets out his phone]<br /><br />AMIR: Don't take a picture. Don't tweet it. This lipstick was expensive as shit, too. It wasn't... yeah. This feeling sucks. It was like a total, total gut-check. Maybe it's like the beret thing. It takes... It's too far away from The Joker that... girl scout outfit. What?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say anything.<br /><br />AMIR: Maybe you didn't hear. I'm gonna give it one more shot. 3, 2, 1... WHY SO SE-<br /><br />JAKE: I heard it!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay!",

There's crumbs all over you.<br /><br />AMIR: This is sand, okay? I was eating a sand-based nut, a sandnut, so there's cookie sand all over me if that's what you're bitching about.<br /><br />JAKE: How is it cookie sand if it was a sandnut? Also, neither of those things exist. Cookie sand and sandnut? You made them both up.<br /><br />AMIR: Create your own reality and don't wait for happiness, okay?

Bad logic, right? Make the tea later.<br /><br />Amir: I knew you were gonna say that.<br /><br />Jake: If you knew I was gonna say that then why did you do it?<br /><br />Amir: Because I didn't know until you said it, and then right as you said it I knew!<br /><br />Jake: Okay then you didn't know!

(Jake looks confused) 8 a.m: Rent donkeys, hire a local jackass, pun intended, to help us navigate...<br /><br />Jake: Okay stop it, do you think we're at the Grand Canyon?<br /><br />Amir: (Hesitates, folds the paper) No.<br /><br />Jake: (Grabs paper) A lot of this stuff is canyon related.<br /><br />Amir: (Dismissively) Name twelve. And make sure that they're about the Grand Canyon specifically, not just about any canyon.<br /><br />Jake: Great. Easy. 9 a.m: Get a view of the canyon, she is grand, and she is canyon.<br /><br />Amir: I am a shame.<br /><br />Jake: 10 a.m: Get matching Grand Canyon tattoos. They should read This friendship is as grand as the canyon. Arizona.<br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah. 11 a.m. just says Arizona eight times in a row.<br /><br />Amir: This is a public shaming of me.<br /><br />Jake: No it's... We're in a... No it's not.<br /><br />Amir: This is so messed up. I made like an amazing jackass-donkey pun earlier, and we're just glossing over it.<br /><br />Jake: The stuff that's not canyon related is just straight up mean.<br /><br />Amir: (Whiny) It's poking fun at society! Yeah okay, who are we if we can't laugh at ourselves?<br /><br />Jake: (Talking as Amir is whining) Oh my god, stop with the voice.<br /><br />Amir: You know not everyone has these rose colored sunglasses that you do!<br /><br />Jake: 1 p.m: Break all the baby food at the supermarket so the babies have no food?<br /><br />Amir: Occupy Baby Street.<br /><br />Jake: 2 p.m. says French kiss a French bulldog.

Oh, and by the way, (spills first smoothie) Oh, yeah!<br /><br />GUY: You poured that all over your pants!<br /><br />AMIR: It's hard to do that in this net, Ok, at least I went for it.<br /><br />(cut to Jake and Ben walking down path, Ben hugging Jake)<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you gotta walk on your own for a minute.<br /><br />BEN: Hey, are you getting tired?<br /><br />JAKE: No, I'm not tired.<br /><br />BEN: 'Cause I could tickle you to keep you awake.

I wish nothing but the best for you too. Don't-- (Jake turns on radio and quickly turns it off) <br /><br />I have a headache. <br /><br />Jake: You were just singing. <br /><br />Amir: I can sing, I just, it hurts me to hear other people sing. It's like how you can make fun of my mom, but I can't. <br /><br />Jake: That's not how that works. <br /><br />Amir: It's 'cause I'm too close to her, but you have a lot of material to work with--she's dumb and short.

I'm really good at navigating city streets. <br /><br />Jake: We have to get to the airport. We have to make our flight. This is the only way we can go. <br /><br />(Amir farts) Amir: Jerk. <br /><br />Jake: Don't say jerk as you fart like that. Roll down your window. <br /><br />Amir: Let's just clambake it.

(Amir laughs, honks horn in frustration that Jake doesn't) LAUGH! <br /><br />Jake: Why would you do that? <br /><br />Amir: Lemme just look at your phone. Nngh (same noise as before). (Into phone) Hello, 411? Yeah, Amir here. Amir Hurwitz. Why the traffic? <br /><br />Jake: It doesn't matter why there's traffic. We have to stay on this road no matter what. <br /><br />Amir: She says hold on, but it's gridlock. <br /><br />Jake: Gimme my phone. <br /><br />Amir: How bout I drop it?<br /><br />Jake: How bout you don't.<br /><br />Amir: What's the magic word?<br /><br />Jake: Please don't.<br /><br />Amir: Be my slave for a month. <br /><br />Jake: Fine. <br /><br />Amir: Fine what? <br /><br />Jake: Fine, I'll be your slave for a month. <br /><br />(Amir throws phone out the window)<br /><br />Amir: Let's just do you're my slave for two weeks, okay? <br /><br />Jake: No. <br /><br />Amir: For two measly weeks you won't even be my slave?

How Many Words Would It Take by Amir Valarie Blumenfeld.<br /><br />JAKE: You know you can change your middle name, right?<br /><br />AMIR: (Reciting poem)  How many words would it take to accurately express what you mean to me?  How can you scientifically quantify how much lighter I become when you enter my day and how heavy I feel when you leave?  How can I describe how my smile just appears magnetically when  I see your face?  (Jake smiles)  How can I possibly count my thoughts of you when I think of you so constantly?  As thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts, within thoughts make it impossible to remember where one began and the other ended.  Time folds into itself as I am already nostalgic for our future and look forward to our past.  For the rest of my life, I love you.  <br /><br />(There is a short pause as Jake tries to find the words to say)<br /><br />JAKE: Wow...that was...<br /><br />AMIR: DUMB, I know!  (Chuckles)<br /><br />JAKE: No, it was good.  It was really, really good.<br /><br />AMIR: I texted the first part of it to myself while I was takin' a shit.<br /><br />JAKE: Dude, it was incredible.<br /><br />AMIR: And the second part, I was mid-wipe so I just said \"fuck it, I'll leave it as a voicemail to myself\".  Haha.  Are you crying?<br /><br />JAKE: (Wiping eyes)  Yeah!  I welled up a little.  Who're you giving that to?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, I just freestyled it off the top of my dick, probably nobody; I'm gonna can it.  (Amir begins to bring the poem down to the garbage)<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, hey, hey!  N-n-n-no, no Man!<br /><br />AMIR: What?  You already have a card.<br /><br />JAKE: No, Dude, I lost it!  It was better than yours and now it's gone!   <br /><br />AMIR: (Points at the heart shaped piece of paper in Jake's hand) What about that?<br /><br />JAKE: It's a placeholder.  It's a suckier version of the card I wrote; a dummy version.    <br /><br />AMIR: Read it.<br /><br />JAKE: I'll read it to you and if you think it's shwing-worthy then it might just be my actual card.<br /><br />AMIR: Um...sh—<br /><br />JAKE: (Clears throat obnoxiously)  (Begins to recite poem)  You are blazing to me.  You are so blazing.  No, you're better than blazing; you're blazin'.  No 'g', just an apostrophe, you don't need a 'g', 'cause I'm your G.  So we drop the 'g'.  (Amir scratches his head)  And tonight, you gonna drop your g-string.  Let me see that crack, Girl.  I bet it ain't whack, Girl.  Love, your not-so-secret-admirerer, J-Witz.  (End of poem)  If you thought it sucked it's only because I can't read for shit.<br /><br />AMIR: No...Man, it was...good...<br /><br />JAKE: You say that and you mean it, but you're wrong.  <br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: What did yours say?<br /><br />AMIR: What does it matter what mine says?<br /><br />JAKE: 'Cause I'm gonna amend mine!  A little bit!  Based on some of the words you said.<br /><br />AMIR: But I wrote—<br /><br />JAKE: Just say some of it 'cause I can't remember how stupid it was!  <br /><br />AMIR: I don't—<br /><br />JAKE: That's all!<br /><br />AMIR: I don't wanna say any of—<br /><br />JAKE: It was like, \"how can I count the ways by-like how many thoughts within thoughts, within thoughts and then nostalgia for our future and past already\" or something like that.  \"How can I possibly—<br /><br />(Cuts to Sarah continuing the poem aloud, in front of Jake)<br /><br />SARAH: count the ways you are thinking within, thoughts ,within thoughts, I lost count.  That's the point.  I can't count worth shit because I forget how number work when you're around because you are blazin'.  Love, J-Witz.  What is this?

It's not like <br /><br />I'm gonna wear it on the same day! We can alternate days!<br /><br />Jake: Oh you want to alternate! So that means, like, I have to call you before work—I have to check in with you to see if you're <br /><br />wearing my shirt!<br /><br />Amir: You wear it on Monday, I can wear it on Tuesday, you can wear it on Wednesday, I wear it on Thursday, you wear it on Friday, I <br /><br />wear it on Saturday, you wear it Sunday, I can wear it Monday, you can wear it on Tuesday, I can wear it on Wednesday. That's how we <br /><br />should—<br /><br />Jake: I'm not—then we can just share this shirt by your logic, right? Yeah—<br /><br />Amir: Yeah! I wanna do that! I wanna share clothes with you, but I feel like I would sort of ease into that, by getting the same <br /><br />clothes as you, and then you'd realize that, why are we wasting so much money!<br /><br />Jake: Knowing that you wanna do that ultimately really freaks me out. Stop—I wanna s—<br /><br />Amir: We should just wear the same clothes! We can wear the same clothes! Put them in the same—!<br /><br />(They stop yelling over each other)<br /><br />Jake: FINE! I got it at Forever 21! Okay? Are you happy now? Forever 21! There's a unisex section upstairs!<br /><br />(Amir is suddenly wearing the same shirt)<br /><br />Amir: I got the shirt. I said I wouldn't get the shirt, and I did. I did get the shirt. I called your bluff, and you lost.<br /><br />Pat: Woah, woah, twinsies! Did you guys plan that, or...?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />",

      "script": "[NOTE: because there is a lot of play with the pronunciation of the word bagel in this episode, it was a little tough to transcribe in some areas.  If anyone has suggestions for how to improve those areas of the script, as well as the script in general, I'm happy to make adjustments]<br /><br />INTRO<br /><br />Jake: You're watching Jake and Amir!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: Why are your hands so sticky?<br /><br />Amir: I don't know!<br /><br />EPISODE<br /><br />[Several people are standing, quietly preparing bagels]<br /><br />Amir: I had a fuck dream last night.<br /><br />[Everyone but Jake leaves]<br /><br />Jake [as crowd dissipates]: Come on.  Oh, sorry. [to Amir] What are you doing?<br /><br />Amir: What? I brought bagels* for the whole company and you're doggin' on me for mentioning, just mentioning that I had a dream? I haven't even gotten into the lurid details yet. And they are wet.<br /><br />*[Amir pronounces bagel \"bag-el\" as opposed to \"bei-gel\", which is the normal pronunciation]<br /><br />Jake: It was inappropriate.<br /><br />Amir: You bet your ass it was.  Imagine every koala ever, in a bikini.<br /><br />Jake: Did you buy bagels for everybody just so you can act like an asshole?<br /><br />Amir: Ok, fine, congratulations for this.  Guys, everyone throw up your bagels right now.  Throw them up or start paying me for them.<br /><br />Jake: You can't do that.<br /><br />Amir: Guess what? Everyone owes me two bucks now because Jake's doggin' me.  We'll call it a \"Jake doggin' me fee.\"<br /><br />Jake: You showed up with bagels around your nipples.<br /><br />Amir: As a joke.<br /><br />Jake: You said \"bagels on me.\"<br /><br />Amir: As a joke.<br /><br />Jake: And now, you're demanding money, not as a joke, right? You can't do that, it's fucked up.  It's a form of robbery.  It's extortion.  It's also pronounced bagel.<br /><br />Amir: What am I saying?<br /><br />Jake: You're saying bagel.<br /><br />Amir: Right, bagel.<br /><br />Jake: No, wrong it's-<br /><br />Amir: Bagel.<br /><br />Jake: It's-<br /><br />Amir: Bagel.<br /><br />Jake: Let me say it.  Because you said it wrong three times in a row, ok?<br /><br />Amir: Bagel.<br /><br />Jake: Let's go one syllable at a time.<br /><br />Amir: Ok.<br /><br />Jake: Say \"beig\"<br /><br />Amir: Daeg.<br /><br />Jake: \"el\" [with a soft \"e\"]<br /><br />Amir: \"el\" [with a hard \"e\"]<br /><br />Jake: Bagel.<br /><br />Amir: Baeg-el.<br /><br />[Jake shakes his head]<br /><br />Amir: Worse, right?<br /><br />[Emily enters and begins to get a bagel]<br /><br />Amir: Woah, three bucks! You prick in a wig! Three bucks!<br /><br />Jake: Relax, dude.<br /><br />Amir: You owe me money you skinny bitch!<br /><br />[Murph enters]<br /><br />Murph: Eh! Cool it! That's my girlfriend, buddy.<br /><br />Jake: No way, how long?<br /><br />Murph: Fuck you!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus. You know, dude, she didn't even take a bagel.<br /><br />Amir: Bagel! You frickin' nimrod!<br /><br />Jake: You never had any intention at all of giving these away for free, did you?<br /><br />Amir [suddenly wearing black and white striped sunglasses]: I hustle. Ok?<br /><br />Jake: I hate that you can put those on so quickly.<br /><br />Amir: I spend a penny to make two. Do you know what it's like to grow up on the street? To be hood? Or would you rather just suck off Uncle Sam and swallow what he gives ya? By the way, that was my dream last night.<br /><br />Jake: You have a job. You could make so much more money doing a good job here, in the office. Did you really blow Uncle Sam in your dream last night?<br /><br />Amir [no longer wearing sunglasses]: I could clear five dollars easy street if all y'all just ponied up six dollars apiece for these Ed Bagley juniors! Ok, make my money work for me!<br /><br />Jake: That's not even- how much did you spend on these bagels?<br /><br />Amir [pulls out a receipt]: Roughly...<br /><br />[Jake pulls the receipt out of his hand]<br /><br />Amir: Don't grab stuff out of my hand, ok? I was gonna bring it up earlier but I was gonna wait-<br /><br />Jake [angrily]: Six hundred dollars! I think you got ripped off.<br /><br />Amir: Look me in my eyes and actually tell me that you think I got ripped off.<br /><br />Jake: I just did. I think you got ripped off.<br /><br />[a moment passes]<br /><br />Amir: No, not buying that, you blinked.<br /><br />[Josh is shown vomiting]<br /><br />Jake: Oh, what is going on?<br /><br />Amir: Alright, listen up everybody. [makes morse code sounds] <br /><br />Jake: Say it!<br /><br />Amir: Y'all now have giardia.  Alright, straight up it's a rare form of food poisoning that lasts three weeks; we're talking vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, infantile jaundice!<br /><br />[More people begin to vomit]<br /><br />Jake [repulsed]: Oh!<br /><br />Amir: Don't worry there is a cure.<br /><br />Jake: What is it?<br /><br />Amir: Bedrest. And that information will cost you six hundred dollars, so... [wearing sunglasses] And I just made a profit!<br /><br />Jake: Take those off!<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

I have to get here before the bouncer because these clubs are exclusive as shit. Great question, I hide in the men's room and pretend I'm the janitor.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright dude, practice; pretend I'm a hot girl.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright.<br /><br />JAKE: (in a hot girl voice) Hey babe.<br /><br />AMIR: Hey!

Will you date me? Cuz I'll be exclusive, and you don't have to be.

Dude don't touch me right now, I'm thirty seconds away from getting line-poon.<br /><br />JAKE: (to Bridget) One drink, okay I'm begging you, one drink, and then I'll grind on you like you've never been ground before.<br /><br />BRIDGET: If you lose that fedora,--<br /><br />(Jake quickly takes off his fedora.)<br /><br />BRIDGET: Let me finish. If you lose that fedora, and you go home, maybe I'll forget about how badly you embarrassed yourself in front of me.<br /><br />JAKE: Damn girl. Aight, you fly.<br /><br />BRIDGET: You're ugly to me.<br /><br />JAKE: Ahkey! Chill!<br /><br />[Amir is talking to the woman behind them in line, and Jake is leaning against the wall of the building.]<br /><br />JAKE: (to BRIDGET) Hey, why don't you dump your iPhone boyfriend and go out with this Man-Droid?<br /><br />BRIDGET: Oh my God that is the DUMBEST thing I have EVER HEARD.<br /><br />JAKE: Ooh my God! Stop being mean to me!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey everybody, check it out, I think there's a whale at this party, somebody's got a blow-hole.

I wouldn't fuck you with his dick! (pointing at Amir)<br /><br />BRIDGET: You look like your chin grew pubes; I wouldn't let you fuck me with anyone's dick!<br /><br />JAKE: Ok well I wouldn't.. take his dick to fu-- You're a fuckin' ten. You're a ten, okay? Can I have your number?<br /><br />BRIDGET: No!<br /><br />JAKE: Here's my phone, put in your number. It doesn't even have to be the real number, I'll never call it<br /><br />[Amir is talking to the woman behind him, and Jake is doing the whale hat trick again.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey dude. (blows into his thumb, and Amir ignores him.) Dude!<br /><br />JAKE: (to Bridget, holding out his phone, slightly crying) It can be fake if you want, I'll chalk it up as a W. I just wanna show my boys that I got one number tonight!<br /><br />JAKE: (to Amir, doing a bad impression of Vince Vaughn's character Trent from Swingers.) I'm a big bear, man! I got these claws, and these fangs, and I'm just battin' the bunny around! (AMIR: What are you talking about?) With this, what do I do with the bunny- It's from Swingings! With Jon Favers, and Vince Vang!<br /><br />JAKE: (to Amir) Pop quiz, hotshot, do you have game?<br /><br />AMIR: Game?<br /><br />JAKE: It's called game. You use it to get with chicks, it's the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />AMIR: I lost my childhood dog today!<br /><br />JAKE: None due respect dude, FUCK your childhood dog!, ok, this is more important. You know Game of Thorns? This is Game of Thongs!<br /><br />AMIR: Game of Thorns?<br /><br />JAKE: Game of Thongs, I said. D-D-DO YA HAVE IT, GAME?<br /><br />JAKE: (awkwardly gyrating back and forth) Uh, you go find a girl, you grind on her, like this, oh hey (he starts grinding on the girl behind them in line, from the front, and a large black man comes from behind her, grabbing Jake and roughing him up) WHOA!

Yeah!<br /><br />(jump scene)<br /><br />AMIR: Need I remind you I picked every single upset last year. <br /><br />JAKE: You only picked upsets last year. Sixteens over ones, fifteens over twos. <br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, and how did I finish?<br /><br />JAKE: In our work pool, you finished dead last. <br /><br />AMIR: (in disbelief) How?

What are you talking about? Suck my dick, okay, I ponied up the dough!<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't! Let's look back just last year. You were mathematically eliminated after the first day. You begged Johnson Hussey for your money back, when he finally gave it to you, you said, Keep the change you filthy animal. I'ma buy back in at a G. You submitted what turned out to be a perfect bracket and a thousand dollars in cash--<br /><br />AMIR: (quietly, doodling): Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: Then you showed up, rolling on E to our office party for the finals. You shredded the money, tore up your bracket and pissed on Sunusi's phone. You screamed, All contracts are null and Lloyd!

I don't even have to go, it's like--(gas)--Oh, oh no. Wow, a little gas. Nothing to see here! -- (AMIR begins to shit, putting his hands on either side of the stall in clear pain). Oh no, here we go. Ohhh, mmmm, oh my God, (poops) poops I shitted again! Wow, that felt big! I'm gonna look down just in a case it's a-- holy shit, yeah, oh my (bleep) that's a record breaker. Three footer, easy, four soaking wet, two dry, two and a half moist, no coil either, just a straight shot. Thicker than a soda can, too. My God, it looks like a boa constrictor trying to get out of a septic tank. I'm a hero and a cool. I gotta snap a pic. W-w-wait! The minute I turn around to snap a pic, the toilet is gonna automatically flush! No! Oh my God! Stop crying, stop crying--okay, cry, cry, let it out, you deserve this! You don't cry that much and even if you did no one would begrudge these tears! Just cry, let it all out, then move past it! Okay okay okay, think! Think think think, you idiot. There's gotta be a way to snag a pic without getting up. Go through your legs. (AMIR tries) Nope, too dark. It's too fricken dark. Ugh, unbelievable. You caught a seventy pound bass and you have to throw it back before (AMIR punches stall wall) anybody even gets to behold its beauty! Good luck bragging about something that doesn't even exist! It looks like ten brown slinkies glued together and nobody's gonna believe a goddamn thing. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!<br /><br />PAT: (at urinal) Are you okay in there, man? It smells like cheese and gasoline.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm not okay! I just gave birth to a brown elephant trunk and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her to the great unknown!<br /><br />PAT: (holds nose) Oh my God, that is ripe! (leaves)<br /><br />AMIR: (thinking) Just stand up! Just stand up and do it, you coward! There's no way that log's getting flushed down anyway! No, no, no, greater fortunes have been lost on less risky propositions! You have to be rational here!<br /><br />(AMIR pulls out his phone and calls JAKE)<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, listen, it's me--don't hang up, don't hang up, don't hang up, okay? I don't want you to do anything weird, I just need you to come over here and put your hand over the sensor so I can stand up and take a picture of my enormous dump. Hello, hello? Ugh!<br /><br />AMIR: (thinking) Dildo! He's a dildo! Ugh! Think, think think think. Uh. This is what you have to do. Take off your shirt and pants, put them over the motion sensor so that it still thinks you're still sitting down, and stand up and take the pic right away! Ha! (claps in head) This makes me a genius, official genius and a cool. From now on nobody will think of Amir Blumenfeld as the guy who couldn't take a shit the size and girth of twelve rubber hoses banded together and dipped and brown paint, no! But rather as a pimp and a philosopher. The best two things you can be. <br /><br />(a MAN walks into the bathroom; upon smelling AMIR's stench, he immediately runs out)<br /><br />AMIR: (thinking) Okay, here we go, Hurwitz. Turn around and snag the pic. Your life as you know it will officially change. Promise me this. Whatever people say, you'll stay humble. (aloud) I promise. (thinking) Three, two, one...<br /><br />(AMIR stands up and tries to take the picture. His shirt, pants, and cell phone all are flushed, as well as his enormous dump)<br /><br />AMIR: Oh no! No, no, no!<br /><br />(new scene, back at the office. JAKE is working. AMIR walks in without shirt and pants on and sits down at his chair.)<br /><br />AMIR: By the way, I know what you're gonna say, but don't bother because I promised myself I'd stay humble, also, thanks for the bathroom suggestion, comprende.

Just−<br /><br />Amir: What were you gonna say?<br /><br />Jake: You obviously took to heart what I said last week when I said I've never heard you have a normal conversation with a normal <br /><br />person in your entire life.<br /><br />Amir: I don't recall...<br /><br />Jake: Unzip that hoodie?<br /><br />(Amir unzips his hoodie to show his t-shirt, and adopts an Ohhh yeah! expression)<br /><br />Jake: Aww, don't be proud! That shirt says I've never had a normal conversation with a normal person in my entire life. I'm a loser! <br /><br />You added that in!<br /><br />Amir: Lucky, breast.<br /><br />Jake: When I told you that last week you welled up. You welled right up like I told you your parents were dead.<br /><br />Amir: I wish.<br /><br />Jake: Wow, dark. You welled up and you said, I'll show you you piece of clid.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: I'll show you I have a friend so normal you won't believe it. Then you sprinted out of the office and I haven't seen you since. <br /><br />I can only presume−<br /><br />Amir: Don't.<br /><br />Jake: −that you were eavesdropping on people's conversations, writing down everything you heard and then getting all of them wrong.<br /><br />Amir: I got all of them right!<br /><br />Jake: No, you didn't! You don't consider things dumb!<br /><br />Amir: You consider me dumb!<br /><br />Jake: Right, because you also don't play things by year.<br /><br />Amir: Yes, I do!<br /><br />Jake: No, the phrase is you play things by ear.<br /><br />Amir: Oh okay so what are you, twelve ears old?<br /><br />Jake and Amir: What?!<br /><br />Jake: You should have heard more than those five phrases by the way. And you didn't leave any space, so I can't imagine what, what was <br /><br />his name? Dan?<br /><br />Amir: Den.<br /><br />Jake: Den? I can't imagine what Den was saying during that conversation. You should have left some pauses in there.<br /><br />(Den (Dan Klein) pops up from behind Jake)<br /><br />Den: Amir!<br /><br />Amir: Den!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus.<br /><br />Den: Vaguely?<br /><br />Amir: Vaguely.<br /><br />Den: Vaguely.<br /><br />Amir: (Wearing sunglasses) Vaguely?<br /><br />Den: Vaguely.<br /><br />Amir: Haha! No man.<br /><br />Den: There's a disconnect here.<br /><br />Amir: Consider it dumb.<br /><br />Den: Play it by year?<br /><br />Amir: What year?<br /><br />Den: Play it by one year?<br /><br />Amir: What year?<br /><br />Den: Hey what year is it?<br /><br />Amir: 2010.<br /><br />Den: 2011? Wanna play it by that?<br /><br />Amir: Consider it dumb.<br /><br />Den: Absurd.<br /><br />Amir: Den!<br /><br />Den: There's a disconnect here.<br /><br />Amir: Vaguely.<br /><br />Den: Bye.<br /><br />Amir: Den!<br /><br />(Den has left)<br /><br />Jake: You know, what I said still stands, because that was not a normal conversation with a normal person.<br /><br />Amir: (Shirtless) That's why I'm keeping the shirt on!<br /><br />",

Let's start the table read<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, you mean the anal bead<br /><br />(silence)<br /><br />MURPH: (laughs and whispers to Emily) It rhymed<br /><br />VINCENT: I meant the table read. It's when we read the scripts that were written this week, at this table, and then I get a sense of how to direct them. <br /><br />AMIR: I am the weakest link, goodnight. (looks at jake for reaction) <br /><br />VINCENT: Amir, let's start with your script because it is by far<br /><br />AMIR: (interrupting) The most viral!<br /><br />VINCENT: The longest is what I was going to say<br /><br />AMIR: It reads fast<br /><br />VINCENT: It doesn't. You wanna pick your cast?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes! Okay... Jake, why don't you play Darrel McMexican <br /><br />JAKE: Such an offensive name.<br /><br />AMIR: He's like a rogue CIA agent with a heart of cold.<br /><br />JAKE: But McMexican? <br /><br />AMIR: (To Emily) And Julia, why don't you play his girlfriend, Pussy Sandwich, which works since that's your actual name.<br /><br />EMILY: Emily. (Amir gives confused look) My name is Emily.<br /><br />AMIR: Right, what did I say?<br /><br />EMILY: Julia and then Pussy Sandwich<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, I think we're saying the same thing?<br /><br />EMILY: No <br /><br />AMIR: Are we not? <br /><br />VINCENT: (butting in) Alright, let's just get started.<br /><br />AMIR: And improvise! Have fun with it! But, stick to the script. That's the most fun you can have. You know, I'm married to the script. (whispering) But I'm willing to cheat. (laughs) <br /><br />VINCENT: Okay, um... (Reading Amir's script) Interior: doesn't matter. Day. A shot of an empty room for three hours. (To Amir) We can't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, we'll see. (winks)<br /><br />VINCENT: (reading) In stumbles our hero, Darrel McMexican. He looks just like Jake, a buff and a cool. <br /><br />JAKE: (reading) My heart, it's cold. I can't breathe.<br /><br />AMIR: (exasperated) CUT. Sorry...um, yeah. You're improvising. <br /><br />JAKE: First of all, you said we could <br /><br />AMIR: Which is fine, yeah<br /><br />JAKE: Second of all, I'm not improvising. <br /><br />VINCENT: (coughing to get everyone's attention) (reading) As Darrel grabs his heart, not just his chest but literally he grabs his heart, his girlfriend enters. 81 years young, jet black hair, like a jet, has Pussy Sandwich for a name.<br /><br />EMILY: (reading) Darrel, Darrel, Darrel McMexican, how are you? <br /><br />AMIR: You're improvising a little too much for my liking , but that's fine.<br /><br />JAKE: She's not improvising at all.<br /><br />EMILY: (reading) It's me. Pussy, Pussy Sandwich. I'm buxom and blonde as the sun.<br /><br />MURPH: Awesome babe, that was so hot<br /><br />(Emily licks Murph's hand, Murph glares at Jake) <br /><br />JAKE: (reading) I look at you and I want to know more about you. Are you a foodie?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, okay, great. So here comes the emotional crux of the whole...piece as it were. Please, as alway's improvise, adlib, yeah, but (pounds the table to get his point across) verbatim! I can't stress that enough. Stick to the script. <br /><br />VINCENT: (reading confusedly) Pussy Sandwich let's out a high pitched queef. We can't hear it, but everyone knows it's there for sure. Dogs from around the city start sprinting to McMexican's apartment. We hear thuds, barking, pounding. These dog's wanna get in and see what's what. They know it's coming from Pussy. (incredibly confused) What they don't know is how or why. <br /><br />AMIR: (smiling) Wow...<br /><br />EMILY: (Murph is angrily staring back and forth at Jake and Emily. Jake is shaking his head in denial) Kiss me you fool, taste my tongue, you gaylord fool.

OK!<br /><br />JAKE: (on the verge of tears) I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE THIS, AMIR WROTE THIS! <br /><br />MURPH: (to Amir) Oh yeah, what's going on here!?<br /><br />AMIR: He was improvising.<br /><br />JAKE: I DIDN'T IMPROVISE!<br /><br />(Murph punches Jake square in the face and holds his head to the table)<br /><br />MURPH: Your ass is mine McMexican! Your ass is MIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEEUUUUUUAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!<br /><br />JAKE: (crying) What the fuck man! <br /><br />END SCENE<br /><br />(Murph and Emily alone) <br /><br />MURPH: I don't know what happened back there.

Jake your booty.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop!<br /><br />AMIR: (joining Jake on couch) Hey, dude, thanks for meeting me here.<br /><br />JAKE: (simultaneously) Oh, bad odor!<br /><br />AMIR: So how do people make money today?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not meeting you here. Ok, I was just in here.<br /><br />AMIR: That's right, creating iPad apps.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't think that I agreed to a meeting. <br /><br />AMIR: And, what better way to create iPad apps than in a meeting that both people agreed to?<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, first app idea. You know how it's hard to manage your time, like time management?<br /><br />JAKE: Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: So this is just a list of other shit that's hard to deal with.<br /><br />JAKE: Really? Number one says wiping. <br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: That shouldn't be that hard.<br /><br />AMIR: And yet it is.<br /><br />JAKE: No it's not.<br /><br />AMIR: Ok.<br /><br />JAKE: (holds up iPad) Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce. <br /><br />AMIR: I was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.<br /><br />JAKE: You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!<br /><br />JAKE: Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.<br /><br />AMIR: That's an example of something I do all the time.<br /><br />JAKE: I know.<br /><br />AMIR: The hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.<br /><br />JAKE: What's the app?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm not always talking about apps.<br /><br />AMIR: So, you hate the Papua New Guinean community, I hate the Papua New Guinean community. So let's just agree-<br /><br />JAKE: Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community. <br /><br />AMIR: Ok. So this app might be a dud. (snorts)<br /><br />AMIR: This one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.<br /><br />JAKE: How?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your iPad. (chuckles)<br /><br />JAKE: Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-<br /><br />AMIR: Barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. That was a picture of-<br /><br />JAKE: Ribs.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right, how did you-<br /><br />JAKE: How is that not what it sounds like?<br /><br />AMIR: You're getting defensive.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my-<br /><br />AMIR: It's called Photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.<br /><br />JAKE: That app has been around for a while.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well I created a lens for it, called fisheye.<br /><br />JAKE: I feel so bad for you, man.<br /><br />AMIR: If you're gonna call me out on every single white lie I tell, just, just leave, I'm serious man.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine.

(gets up)<br /><br />AMIR: I guess so- Bahh!<br /><br />AMIR: You're in a bad place right now and I feel like even if I pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.<br /><br />JAKE: You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?<br /><br />AMIR: (taps iPad) Alright.<br /><br />JAKE: Actually you know what? (takes iPad) I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my God, I have a case for it, relax.<br /><br />JAKE: The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.<br /><br />AMIR: Call me out. Call me out in front of all your big friends so that I can feel small. <br /><br />JAKE: Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't compartmentalize me like I'm a chore. <br /><br />JAKE: You spit all over my fucking arm just now.<br /><br />AMIR: (huggine Jake) I hate when we fight like this.<br /><br />JAKE: Stop!<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, so this one's a hoot and a half.

And if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away.

None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board. <br /><br />AMIR: Right, yeah, yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.<br /><br />AMIR: That's fine, Ok.<br /><br />JAKE: Furthermore,<br /><br />AMIR: Oh?<br /><br />JAKE: You're not smart.<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: You're not getting better.<br /><br />AMIR: Nope.<br /><br />JAKE: You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself.

We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: With your time.<br /><br />AMIR: At least I gave it the old college try, you know?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not sure you did.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, at least I tried my best, you know?

Quit it, alright, you're making me feel weak.<br /><br />JAKE: You are weak.<br /><br />AMIR: (raising voice) Enough! Ok, you're not creative!<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

It's called six months of pumping iron for this one moment.<br /><br />AMIR: Do you think that's a normal thing to wear around the office?<br /><br />JAKE: You think I'm not going to go to the park during lunch? I don't commit to wearing something that makes me feel vulnerable without having an airtight excuse for every line of questioning. Does that make me insecure? You bet your ass it does.<br /><br />AMIR: Just wear a T-Shirt, then, okay? You'll look normal and you won't be as angry.<br /><br />JAKE: GQ Teen says the summer look is Toms shoes, Ray Bans, board shorts, and a muscle tee. Or was that Joseph Gordon-Levitt doppelganger that I saw at the Starbucks on 9th Avenue not styling?<br /><br />AMIR: Doppelganger?<br /><br />JAKE: Wasn't one hundred percent sure it was the 3rd Rock from the Sun star and upon asking for his autograph, I found out it was not. Still snagged this sweet pic though. (shows Amir picture on his phone)<br /><br />AMIR: He looks pissed at you.<br /><br />JAKE: He was!<br /><br />AMIR: So why follow his fashion advice?<br /><br />JAKE: Because a sleeveless shirt for this piece of dirt makes that sweet pussy go squirt. (makes milk come out of his mouth)<br /><br />AMIR: How?<br /><br />JAKE: I 69'd my dad! At a rave!<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: I was obviously joking, the point is that I attend raves! And while I've never done anything more than kiss a bouncer on the cheek to get in and then be sold fake ecstasy by a sweaty teen, still cooler than your last Tuesday.<br /><br />AMIR: I guess-<br /><br />JAKE: -(mocking) I guess? Do you guess? Do you guess? (yelling) I shared a fucking glowing pacifier, dude, with a legit five-and-a-half.

Hey don't you-<br /><br />AMIR: I'm going sleeveless! Yeah! A dank tank for this man stank make the poonani smell rank!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not a tank!

Then he pounds the table with his pen to get the room's attention, and stands up.]<br /><br />AMIR: Alright. Listen up, everyone: I am your speaker. And despite what this guy thinks, [gestures toward the co-worker he wa talking to previously] I'm pretty damn good.<br /><br />[The co-worker laughs nervously.

No. Okay: what're we here to learn?<br /><br />CO-WORKER 3: Search engine optimization.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right. Now: what do I know about SEO? ...nothing. That's right: I'm not an authority on anything; fuck, guys, I'm not even a decent human being.

She said she was accosted in the elevator. Yeah, a skinny nerd tried to push her into the wall, failed, then started crying, and offered to cut her a four-thousand-dollar check to keep the whole thing under wraps.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh...<br /><br />JAKE: He said he didn't want everybody to know he was a punk bitch who couldn't even yoke up a forty-five-year-old dame with a heart of cold.<br /><br />AMIR: Guys, listen up: Ten thousand dollars to the person who can find that perp and bring him to me, dead or alive.<br /><br />JAKE: It was you.<br /><br />AMIR: Correctimundo!

Which may not seem like a lot to you but I live in a god damn trash heap so try not to rub it in my face.

That's right I am quiet, I am clean, and just between you and me, I bake a mean frittata.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you want to keep that a secret just between you two?<br /><br />Amir: How does 4,900 dollars a month sound Mickey? That's right, that's first, last, and security Mickey. We can finally start that organic garden Mickey. That's right, just me you and some fresh basil, just the way we always wanted Mickey. Alright excellent Mickey, that sounds great. That sounds great Mickey, come outside. Come outside and help me carry in this boxspring Mickey it looks heavier than it is Mickey. Are you outside, are you coming outside Mickey? <br /><br />Jake: Why do you say his name this much?<br /><br />Amir: You know why I'm not there Mickey?  Because I'm not coming. I'm not gonna be your roommate Mickey. I live in a god damn trash heap and your rent was too damn high. Your mom's bringing us iced tea in mason jars?  Well that doesn't sound like my dream! That doesn't sound like my idea of a good time Mickey. Hold on, I'm getting another call.<br /><br />Jake: Make your phone calls in the conference room from now on.<br /><br />Amir: Oscar the Grouch speaking. That's fine! That's fine I will vacate your trash heap at ten P.M. because you know why?

In front of all of her friens if you can believe that. <br /><br />JAKE: You know I can't believe that because you just told me he didn't do it to your face because he was too much of a pussy. <br /><br />CHERYL: Don't say that word!<br /><br />JAKE: What word? Pussy?<br /><br />CHERYL: Yea!<br /><br />JAKE: You're saying it.<br /><br />CHERYL: No.<br /><br />JAKE: You say it all the time.<br /><br />CHERYL: I'm allowed to say it.

You cheated on your fiance.<br /><br />Cheryl throws her drink in Jake's face<br /><br />JAKE: Weak dude!<br /><br />CHERYL: That's for making Amir feel like a real douchebag about that whole Olympics thing.  <br /><br />JAKE: You told her about the Olympics thing?<br /><br />AMIR: I tell her everything. Cheryl's my oldest chica.<br /><br />CHERYL: I'm fifty!<br /><br />JAKE: I-I'm still in awe of that fact. <br /><br />CHERYL: Get over it.

You're what?<br /><br />AMIR: Ok, I know what we're doing tonight.  <br /><br />CHERYL: What are we doing tonight.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm picking you up and we are having a fuck Todd night. You know why, because-<br /><br />AMIR and CHERYL: Fuck Todd!<br /><br />CHERYL: Lets pick up a fucking brick or a cinderblock and just throw it into his parent's property or some shit. Lets fucking wreak some real damage.  <br /><br />AMIR: Let's do it. I hate his fuckin' mom. <br /><br />JAKE: You know what, I don't wanna interject here but Cheryl it sounds like you're in the wrong.  <br /><br />CHERYL: You could have had this. <br /><br />JAKE: I'm sorry, I had a shot at that?<br /><br />AMIR: That's right. You coulda been Cheryl's revenge fudge but you had to go off and defend queen pussy Todd.<br /><br />CHERYL: Ya yea.<br /><br />JAKE: Ok this is ridiculous. You know what, Todd's a bitch. He is, he's a real bitch. Everything that you've been saying just, I can't even believe he did it, that all that stuff.  <br /><br />Cheryl wipes a tear from her eye.<br /><br />CHERYL: You really believe that?<br /><br />JAKE: I really do. You know what else I believe?<br /><br />CHERYL: What do you believe?<br /><br />JAKE: He's Dr. Seuss, and I'm Shel Silverstein.  <br /><br />AMIR: Seems pretty equal. <br /><br />CHERYL: They're not that different.<br /><br />JAKE: Equal? What are you talking about? You think Green Eggs and Ham is better than the freaking Giving Tree?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm saying they're both kid's authors.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh well I'm saying it's not a freaking contest. Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio were both baseball players.<br /><br />AMIR: Both great, yea very similar baseball players. <br /><br />CHERYL: I don't know...<br /><br />JAKE: Yea but which one's bett- you know what that was a weird comparison.  <br /><br />CHERYL: Let's do it, let's do this revenge fudge.

Yikes.<br /><br />Emily: Jake!<br /><br />Jake: I'm not looking.<br /><br />Emily: Let me make myself more comfortable.<br /><br />(Emily takes off the towel)<br /><br />Emily: Oops.<br /><br />(Emily winks at Jake)<br /><br />Jake: There's no need to wink, that was insanely forward.<br /><br />Murph: Hurwitz, quit looking at my girl's pussy and come spot me!<br /><br />Jake: I wasn't looking at her pussy, man!<br /><br />Emily: You can. You should.<br /><br />(Jake goes to Murph, who is working out, nude)<br /><br />Jake: Hey man, am I really early?<br /><br />Murph: What did you bring?<br /><br />Jake: Wine.<br /><br />Murph: Och is that a red?<br /><br />Jake: It is, yeah.<br /><br />Murph: Dude I told you we're serving branzino, that's not gonna pair well.<br /><br />Jake: Sorry.

(Sniffs each bottle) Let's go with the Ritratti. Jake what do you think?<br /><br />Jake: Uh, yeah I guess—<br /><br />(Murph and Amir burst into laughter)<br /><br />Jake: Stop it. (To Amir) What are you even doing here?<br /><br />Amir: I'm Murph's butler!<br /><br />Jake: Since when?<br /><br />Amir: Since I've never not been Murph's butler. My dad was his dad's butler and they had a suicide pact and at the last second my dad <br /><br />chickened out and frikkin moved! Yeah! Ever since then I've been paying off his life debt. Throwing this on ice.<br /><br />Jake: Is this still a date? That's still happening, right? This was all supposed to be a double date.<br /><br />Murph: Yes, her name's Neko and she's got swag for days bro.<br /><br />Emily: She's so funny. (Whispering) She's Asian!<br /><br />Jake: Put clothes on! Why are both of you still naked?<br /><br />Murph: Relax, alright? I can shit shower and shave in thirty seconds flat. I'll be back here in a tucked in express button up before <br /><br />you even know what's up. (Doorbell rings) Neko the devil! God hates swag and she's here to meet her maker!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Murph: Get the door, dumbass.<br /><br />Jake: How do I look?<br /><br />Emily: Really handsome. I would eat your asshole.<br /><br />Jake: All I heard was handsome, okay?<br /><br />(Jake opens the door for Neko)<br /><br />Jake: Hey! You must be Neko. I'm Jake. Um... I just met you, (holds up a can of gravy) and this is gravy!<br /><br />(Neko ignores him)<br /><br />Jake: (Partially subvocalizing) Fuck! What are you doing?!<br /><br />(Neko sits on a couch next to Emily)<br /><br />Emily: Oh my god, you are so Asian. Okay, be honest. Are these real? (Emily feels Neko's tits) Oh my god, you're a fucking liar if you <br /><br />say they're real. I feel like I'm in the fucking Silicon Valley, you fucking bitch. I love your tits.<br /><br />Jake: (Still talking to himself by the door) You went to a bodega and got gravy, for this. You're the weakest link.<br /><br />Emily: They're the same fucking size, are you fucking kidding me? These are fucking fake tits! These are the fakest tits I've ever <br /><br />felt! God, they feel good. I'm gonna make Murph buy me these.<br /><br />(Jake is back in the room where Murph was working out, and Murph runs in half-dressed with blood on his hand)<br /><br />Murph: Time! Time! What's my time?<br /><br />Jake: Yeah man it was really quick, but you obviously didn't finish showering. Can't imagine you shit.<br /><br />Murph: I shit in the shower and I tried to smoosh it down the drain. Got everywhere.<br /><br />Jake: You call this getting ready?<br /><br />Murph: As ready as I'll ever be.<br /><br />(Murph holds up a wedding ring)<br /><br />Jake: Holy shit dude, you're proposing! This is insane! Wash your hand! When are you gonna do it?!<br /><br />Murph: Tonight!<br /><br />Jake: After we leave?<br /><br />Murph: During you're here!<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Murph: I mean I want it to be intimate, so I figure, what's more intimate than a double date?<br /><br />Jake: Single date.<br /><br />Murph: Hah. How about this, if you try to leave, I'll kick you in the back!<br /><br />Jake: Easy does it. Easy does it.<br /><br />Amir: (Carrying a tray of sliders) Alright, appetizer time! We're talking pulled pork sliders with a honey dijon glaze.<br /><br />Jake: Red wine coulda worked with that, right?<br /><br />Murph: Yo, you ever taken a picture of your dick next to a slider and told the girl it was a full on burger?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Emily: Yes.<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Murph: (Handing Jake his phone) Check it.<br /><br />Jake: Yikes man, a lot smaller than the slider.<br /><br />Murph: Hah, it's like a... pff... wrong picture so it's like that's a triple quarter pounder or er...

Amir finishes distributing the meals.]<br /><br />AMIR: Welcome, hello, bruchim habaim, and bon giorno, to a culinary experience from all around; our globe... Carpe diem! Seize the fish. Heh! No, tonight we're having carp.<br /><br />MURPH: Nice.<br /><br />AMIR: [imitating a record scratching] Wrickee wrickee-- scratch that. We are having branzino.<br /><br />EMILY: Neko's a vegan. She BBM'd me.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, um... uh, she can have the... bed of arugula-- like, I don't know what to do at this point; I'm sorry.<br /><br />MURPH: It's okay, but-- hey, Jake, uh, if your date had dietary restrictions, you really should have emailed us ahead of time. That would've been polite.<br /><br />JAKE: I--... just met her, so I wouldn't know anything about her dietary restrictions, right?<br /><br />MURPH: Well, you just threw him a curveball that he can't hit, and I kind of need tonight to go perfectlyyyyyyyyyy...<br /><br />[Murph holds his hands up, his right between Emily and his left, so only Jake can see the ring he's already wearing.]<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Okay, I saw it, put it away...<br /><br />[Murph holds his right hand closer to Emily, she kisses his palm, and he lowers his hands again.]<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Good save.<br /><br />AMIR: Uh... it's fine. It's fine. Neko, um, do you eat beef? Or, do you not, because you're a fucking vegan now, all of a sudden-- I can't-- I'm sorry.<br /><br />[Amir walks off. Murph gets up to follow him, and shoots Jake a look of disappointment.]<br /><br />JAKE: That's not on me, right? ...Buddy? Okay.<br /><br />[Murph goes to talk to Amir just outside the dining room. Amir is chugging a glass of pinot grigio.]<br /><br />MURPH: Hey, c'mon, c'mon. Easy on the grig', easy on the grig'.<br /><br />AMIR: [ranting rapidly, barely retaining any semblance of composure] I just can't believe she fucking did that to me like that. And in the middle of a fucking meal? What kind of timing is that?<br /><br />MURPH: I know. It's Jake's fault. It's Jake's fault. He raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, he raw-dogged me, h-- I feel like he bent me over a table and dogged me raw or something. He raw-dogged me! Yeah.<br /><br />MURPH: That's exactly what he did. He just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, and he did it raw! That's the worst part. I feel like if he lubed me up-- okay, fine. That's one thing. Whatever. Moist: it slides right in-- Yeah! Just spit. [makes a spitting noise] Slides right in, slides right out; it doesn't hurt that much. But for him-- for him to raw-dog us like that?<br /><br />MURPH: [simultaneously] Alright. Right; spit-- just spit on it. That's all I'm asking. Just spit-- just one. Right. That's fine.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey-- you guys know I can hear you, right? This was not my fault--<br /><br />MURPH: It was his fault!<br /><br />AMIR: It was.<br /><br />MURPH: But you're ready for this, okay? You can handle it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />[Murph pats Amir on the shoulder.]<br /><br />MURPH: Go!<br /><br />[Back in the dining room, Emily is staring at Jake and sensually licking a piece of fish she's holding with her bare hands.]<br /><br />JAKE: You know, that's not hot. Your hands probably smell like fish now.<br /><br />MURPH: [returning to the table with Amir] Whoa ho ho! Nobody touch their dinner until I post this to Pinterest. This is the most pinteresting thing I've seen all week. [he leans over Jake's shoulder] Jake, you're gonna re-pin that, right?<br /><br />JAKE: I'd have to sign up for an account.<br /><br />MURPH: Good, so you'll do that?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah. You know what? When I go home tonight, I'll sign up for an account.<br /><br />MURPH: I'd feel much more comfortable if you'd just do it now.<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Not this second, okay?<br /><br />MURPH: [whispering] Jake, don't fuckin' embarrass me at my house, dude.<br /><br />[Jake grabs his iPhone.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's not gonna let me do it from my phone.<br /><br />MURPH: Here.<br /><br />[Murph procures a green iPad from somewhere, and hands it to Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: This is insane, that you're making me do this.<br /><br />MURPH: Don't talk to me.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. I'm on Pinterest. Here, just re-pinned it.<br /><br />EMILY: Babe, make sure that he pins some other stuff. Otherwise it'll look like a dummy account.<br /><br />MURPH: She's right... Fuck it, let's browse!<br /><br />JAKE: Fuck what? Dinner? The date?<br /><br />EMILY: Babe, make sure that he shows his feminine side but also his masculine pride.<br /><br />MURPH: Ya gots to! Yo, that kale smoothie looks dope.<br /><br />JAKE: Are we still on a date? Is this even still a date? Because I'd feel like I was missing out if Neko had said anything to me, ever! Neko! ...Neko! Come on.<br /><br />AMIR: All right! So, this is a most interesting little dish; it's sort of a palate-cleanser in terms that it's a spinach hazelnut salad with onions, olives, and a citrus balsamic vinaigrette.<br /><br />[As Amir describes the salad, Emily smiles slyly and runs her foot up Jake's leg under the table. Jake shakes his head, but Emily nods back. Jake points at Murph, who's still standing over his shoulder, and mouths He's your boyfriend, then pushes her foot back down away from him.]<br /><br />AMIR: I know what you're thinking: Salad in between the meals? Well, we sort of had a... special little customer who needed a special little salad, so here we are.<br /><br />EMILY: Neko's allergic to nuts. [kicks Jake under the table]<br /><br />AMIR: Is she! Okay, Neko, how 'bout this? How 'bout you [Amir begins furiously dismantling the salad with his hands, throwing hazelnuts onto the floor] eat, around, the, nuts? How 'bout that, Neko? Huh? ...Sorry, it--<br /><br />MURPH: Hey hey, focus up, I need your feedback on this pin: pink aztec dress, or cupcake kebabs? I can't pin 'em both.<br /><br />JAKE: Why not?<br /><br />MURPH: You don't get a say! You don't get a say.<br /><br />JAKE: This is my account! These are my pins!<br /><br />[Emily uses her feet to rip Jake's shirt off and drag it under the table.]<br /><br />JAKE: 'Ey-- Weak!<br /><br />MURPH: Oh, ho ho! I didn't realize we were poppin' shirts; I was gonna wait until after the gelato, but... you only YOLO once!<br /><br />[Murph begins undressing.]<br /><br />JAKE: We're not popping shirts, and that's not the phrase.<br /><br />EMILY: [also disrobing] Let's play spin the bottle.<br /><br />[Amir, having taken off his tux, begins pouring out a nearly-full bottle of wine onto the floor.]<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, I got the bottle!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, I brought that.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm doin' you a favor, bro!<br /><br />[Everybody laughs but Jake.]<br /><br />MURPH: Ha ha ha!

That's a re-spin.<br /><br />[Jake goes to spin again, but Murph stops him.]<br /><br />MURPH: I don't like it any more than you do, Jake, but we need to kiss passionately.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Why?<br /><br />MURPH: [whispering] Because those are the rules. And they were pretty convenient when you were tonguing my soulmate, AKA my future wife!<br /><br />[Murph holds up his hand out of Emily's view again, showing Jake the ring.]<br /><br />JAKE: [whispering] Dude, take that off. Take it off.<br /><br />MURPH: Kiss me, Jake.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. One, two, three.<br /><br />[Jake and Murph lean in and quickly kiss each other.]<br /><br />JAKE: There, dude.

You're an adult! You're a grown-up and a you're doing this.<br /><br />Amir: Thank you! Er, you're wel—sor—you're welc—no—sorry!<br /><br />Jake: This is some really elementary school level shit, buddy.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah that means it's high school level shit, not buddy.<br /><br />Jake: Still be pretty immature then, right? Since you're almost 30?<br /><br />Amir: I don't not appreciate, or the opposite of appreciate that so—<br /><br />Jake: Your nose is bleeding.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, dammit. Er, fine, good. Frig it! I'm overthinking it!<br /><br />Jake: Okay, well you know what, if thinking of opposites makes your nose bleed, I'd advise you not to partake in Opposite Day.<br /><br />Amir: No! Er, yes!<br /><br />Jake: Or at least go back to school. Try to make yourself smart.<br /><br />Amir: Okay, you know what? For the rest of the day, I'm not going to ignore you.<br /><br />Jake: Fine. I'm just gonna leave you with one final thought: I have a vagina, you have a penis.<br /><br />Amir: No, today we are both having a vagina.<br /><br />Jake: Nah, sorry man. Today, I have a tiny little vagina, and you have a big ol' penis.<br /><br />Amir: I have a pussy! I have a tight little pussy! (Jake films Amir) And, I'm a nerd! And, we're not friends!<br /><br />Jake: Great, I got that all on camera.<br /><br />Amir: Delete that video you fucking dickwad.<br /><br />Jake: So it's not Opposite Day anymore.<br /><br />Amir: Opposite Day just took a big old timeout when I became concerned about what you're gonna be doing with that footage of me saying <br /><br />some pretty compromising shit! Namely, that I have a pussy, that I'm a nerd, and that we aren't friends!<br /><br />Jake: That was everything you said.<br /><br />Amir: No. Yes. What?<br /><br />Jake: Right. So definitely I am posting that video online. That's why I took it.<br /><br />Amir: At least say that it's Opposite Day—<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: —in the caption!<br /><br />Jake: No!<br /><br />Amir: Good. Fine. Everybody please listen up.

      "script": "[Introduction]<br /><br />Amir: You're watching Jake and Amir, but I bet you're just looking at Jake! <br /><br />Jake: Wow, low self esteem. <br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />[Jake is sitting at his desk. Amir enters, sits at his desk, clears his throat and unrolls a scroll]<br /><br />Jake: Not another scroll dude <br /><br />Amir: Top 10 first date ideas: by Jacob-<br /><br />Jake: No!<br /><br />Amir: Penn Cooper-<br /><br />Jake: No!<br /><br />Amir: Hurwitz<br /><br />Jake: No! Use your own name!<br /><br />Amir: Number 10 <br /><br />Jake: You sick fuck! Use you own name!<br /><br />Amir: Where and when. Let it be her call, it is 2011 after all<br /><br />Jake: It's actually 2012 and right off the bat first up on your top 10 date ideas is sort of a cop out so you don't have to choose one <br /><br />Amir: Number 9: feeling wine! laughs<br /><br />Jake: Not that good of a joke <br /><br />Amir: Take her to a wine bar; and not a place that's close, go real far; and not in a plane, drive in a car. That's right, go to wine country - Napa Valley, California together. <br /><br />Jake: Great! <br /><br />[While Jake is talking, Amir plays peekaboo behind the scroll]<br /><br />Jake: So on your first date you want to take a cross-country drive with a stranger and then spend several days in wine country with them? That's like a nine day excursion buddy- <br /><br />[Amir still peeks from behind the scroll, this time wearing sunglasses]<br /><br />Jake: Stop doing that!<br /><br />Amir: Number 8: Take your mother on a date. The first chick you were inside of and you didn't even call her. Now that's baller. <br /><br />Jake: That's disgusting <br /><br />Amir: Lucky number sleven: change your name to Kevin! <br /><br />Jake: Weird. Not a date<br /><br />Amir: Meet her in heaven. That's right a Romeo and Juliet group suicide so you could spend all of eternity together. <br /><br />Jake: Why do you write everything on these scrolls? Like these ancient treasure maps you seem to have? <br /><br />Amir: Six: stands for chicks. That's right, it's the year 2000, so wherever she wants to go you make it happen, Cap'n. <br /><br />Jake: That is the second time you've: 1) gotten the year wrong, and 2) avoided choosing a date spot <br /><br />Amir: High five: smoke a bowl and roll. Wake and bake and make her make you a steak. You're ingesting weed and ecstasy, and guess what day it is... X-mas eve.<br /><br />Jake: Have you done that before? <br /><br />Amir: Yes! Number 4 is a city so nice they named it Rice. Rice, Texas. <br /><br />Jake: Another road trip?<br /><br />Amir: You actually fly in through Dallas! It's a hub!<br /><br />Jake: Fine.<br /><br />Amir: Number 3: will you marry me? <br /><br />Jake: Too much, too fast, way too soon! <br /><br />Amir: I don't need an answer tonight, but I do need a promise in writing that you'll love me forever. <br /><br />Jake: That's more than an answer. That's a contract. <br /><br />Amir: All marriages are arranged, if you include destiny. <br /><br />Jake: I don't <br /><br />Amir: Number 2: Darlin' it's always been you. Please say I do, I have a rabbi a priest and a mosque on standby. <br /><br />Jake: That last one is not a person. By the way, these are all still first date suggestions, right? <br /><br />Amir: Honestly, I'm just trying to get laid. <br /><br />Jake: Bad way <br /><br />Amir: Number 1: you are the one <br /><br />Jake: Okay <br /><br />Amir: I'm down on one knee and this is my plea. You are the prettiest girl that I ever did see. So you ask that Lady: Will you marry me?<br /><br />[Both stay silent as Amir rolls up the scroll]<br /><br />Amir: Well?<br /><br />Jake: Well what?<br /><br />Amir: Well, thoughts on the list? <br /><br />Jake: Why do you do this? Why do you stay up at night in your apartment making these weird lists? And you know what, even if you get some kind of perverse pleasure out of writing the lists, why bring them to work, and read them to me, when I don't like it? <br /><br />Amir: Great, so a simple yes or no would have sufficed. <br /><br />Jake: It actually wouldn't have sufficed, because you said: Thought's on the list? That's not a yes or no question<br /><br />Amir: And? What are your thoughts on the list? <br /><br />Jake: It's a bad list. It's a bad list and you're a bad person. <br /><br />Amir: Wow! That was scoff unexpected... I honestly thought you loved it.<br /><br />",

Paul is standing up, talking to them. Amir is standing and wearing a denim vest.)<br /><br />Paul: Hey everybody, thanks for coming today. Uh, the reason I wanted to have this all-hands meeting is because that there are a lot of new faces at the company, and I thought this would be a good chance to get to know each other. So why don't we go around the room, everybody say your name, what you do, and maaaybe a fun fact about yourself. I'll start. I'm Paul, I'm the CEO, and my favorite movie is Con Air.<br /><br />(Everybody sitting at the table nods in recognition. Amir starts laughing in a forced tone.)<br /><br />Amir: Heh heh heh. NOT. Bad movie, (Amir pumps his vest) bad you.<br /><br />Jake: Bad vest.<br /><br />Amir: Nooo, it's jeans.<br /><br />Paul: Anyway, Julie do you want to go?<br /><br />Julie: Um, my name is Julie--<br /><br />(Amir holds his palms up, as if to defend himself)<br /><br />Amir: Woah, hotty!

(looks over at Amir)<br /><br />Amir: Holy shit a star is born! Everybody Shia Labeouf is in the house, and he's ready to take the floor.<br /><br />Michael: (still introducing himself) Uh, I'm an intern--<br /><br />Amir: You're a God! You're an A-list God!<br /><br />Michael: And I once ate an entire pint of Ben  Jerry's Phish Food.<br /><br />Amir: You once made out with Megan Fox's box on the set of Transformers the first, you humble bitch. Brag a little! You've earned it! (Chuckling, then whisper) Shia-it.<br /><br />Streeter: Hey everyone, I'm Streeter Seidell--<br /><br />Amir: You mean Streeter Pie-Fell, as in a Pie Fell, in your mouth, and you pretty much... loved it. (Chuckling)<br /><br />Streeter: Yeah right, exactly. Uh, I'm the editor in chief here--<br /><br />Amir: Editor in cheese? (snort) You wish you were in cheese.<br /><br />Streeter: (Below his breath at Amir) Alright, c'mon. (Back to introduction) And uh, my favorite food--<br /><br />Amir: Is everything.<br /><br />Streeter: Alright I walked right into that one.<br /><br />(Amir nods)<br /><br />Jake: Uh, I'm Jake--<br /><br />Amir: This man needs no introduction, and if you don't know who he is (points to the door) get the fuck out.<br /><br />(The person sitting next to Jake stands up and walks out)<br /><br />Jake: (Looking at the person walking out). Are you... C'mon.<br /><br />(Paul walks out of the room, several others follow him.)<br /><br />Jake: I'm a writer here--<br /><br />Amir: You're more than that. You're a generous man, you're a kind soul, and you're engaged. A family man, everyone.<br /><br />Jake: Paul just said to say what we do with the company.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, Paul also said that his favorite movie was Con Air but nobody called him out on that!<br /><br />Jake: You did! Where did you get that vest?<br /><br />Amir: Allow me to give Jake's interesting fact, we're in love.<br /><br />Jake: I won a spelling bee in forth grade.<br /><br />Amir: And you deserve to win it in fifth.<br /><br />Jake: That doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />Amir: Alright, my turn.<br /><br />Jake: It's actually not.<br /><br />Amir: My name is Amir Valerie Blumenfeld, I am an unpaid consultant for this company, I once killed an innocent child, and I love mini-golf. (Mimes putting the ball) It was not on purpose, but it's something that I live with, every day. (Winks)<br /><br />Streeter: Okay, what?<br /><br />Amir: That's right! I once shot 3 holes in one in a row it wasn't an accident either, the killing.<br /><br />Julie: You monster.<br /><br />Amir: I am a monster. On the golf course I take no prisoners. Also I will never un-see that child's face. Every blink is a reminder and every time my eyes aren't open she's just in my minds eye, taunting me. (Makes a scary face). Bleh.<br /><br />Michael: How could you do that?<br /><br />Amir: How could you do that? Crystal Skull? We saw that, it was garbage! I killed a child? (Amir starts crawling to where Michael is sitting across the table). Yeah, well you killed a franchise!<br /><br />(Streeter grabs Amir by his vest and pushes him against the table)<br /><br />Streeter: Hey! Hands off the beef!<br /><br />Amir: Don't eat my vest. Don't eat my vest. I'm serious man do not eat my friggin vest.<br /><br />",

Is that your name? Was he a milk man?<br /><br />Jake: He's had a series of different occupations.<br /><br />Milk Man: Ah, sorry sir, I have been a milk man my entire life. I bring milk to man, much like how a mail man brings mail to milk to man!<br /><br />Jake: You know what? Tell me this. What's your name?

We got that August 13th, open wide, here we go (starts pouring horribly chunky, half solidified milk into Amir's mouth and all over his face) open wide, good man! We're good to go! We're good to go! Milk man, milk man, milk man! And that'll do it, Amir that's the whole bottle. Do you want another?<br /><br />Amir: I'm okay for now, I think...<br /><br />Milk Man: You got it friend!

Didn't realize y'all hated me so much. Owie Zowie. But, not everyone told me to shut up twice, therefore the email thread, unlike Murph's grandmother, lives.<br /><br />Amir: Low blow? HELL NO!<br /><br />Jake: Hell yes. I guess people stopped responding to the thread and started talking to you in person, because your next email says, I've had it up to here with people coming by my desk and being mean to me.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: I don't know why you guys have this mob mentality, but you sheep need to learn how to think individually.<br /><br />Amir: BAH, BAA! And guess what happened next... my neck was stapled!<br /><br />Jake: Yep, saw that. Your next email, Who's the coward bitch that stapled my neck? I blinked for a second and I missed you, missed you, now I gotta kissed you. Make yourself known. Rosie responds It was me. and I guess you had to retaliate in some way, because your next email is Who's the prick that threw that brick at my head when I went to hit Rosie? Be a man and fess up to the crime so that I can do the time. Owen Parsons responds It was me. And you reply, 9 minutes later, Who's the loser who tripped me when I went to staple Owen's neck? I tripped and almost hit my head really hard, that would've been a lawsuit for sure.<br /><br />Amir: WORST. DAY. EVER.<br /><br />Jake: Yes, I imagine it was, because you sent out another email. (Amir is shown eating his sandwich.) I was just hit with another fucking brick. Are you shitting me with these? That makes 3 bricks on the gay. I don't know where you guys even got these things or the audacity to hurl them at me at such close range-- are you not full anymore?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah. <br /><br />Jake: Why are you still typing these emails?<br /><br />Amir: I wanted to diffuse the situation!<br /><br />Jake: You think this is diffusing the situation? Y'all are gonna have to bind and gag me if you want peace and quiet around here. And good luck, because I'm got going quietly. Your last email, sent 30 seconds before I got here, is obviously typed with your face, it's just MMPHUSFISDMPH. And then somehow, in perfect english, Gangam style.<br /><br />Amir: That's my email signature!}<br /><br />Josh: Why did you ungag him?!<br /><br />Jake: C'mon dude, hasn't he suffered enough?<br /><br />(Amir's neck is stapled.)<br /><br />Amir: Oh, he got me again! The prick hit me again! Did ya see that, with the stapler?!<br /><br />(A brick is thrown)<br /><br />Jake: Ok, they're throwing bricks.<br /><br />Amir: Get out of here, save yourself, I can take it! (Jake flees, Amir is hit with a brick.) Ooh, hit me square!<br /><br />END<br /><br />",

It happens, Nance!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, can you please not talk in limericks?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, really, that's a limerick?

Don't take matters like that into your own hands.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, no more bomb threats, Adolf.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you take off that costume? OK?

(snorts) In my messed up mind, like I can delude myself into thinking that you called me in a mustard costume and asked me to wear this.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I mean, I guess so.<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, if you want to know the whole truth, I saw a doctor this weekend, a psychotherapist specializing in manic depression and acute schizophrenia, and, uh, he I guess diagnosed me, for lack of a better term, with having these delusions of grandeur and, uh, made it quite abundantly clear to me that, without medication, that you just got punked, bitch! Ha, ha ha, these costumes were a coincidence!<br /><br />JAKE: Come on, dude! We just turned a corner!<br /><br />VAMPIRE: Bleh!

You've been rubbing everyone the wrong way for the past four or five years.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, that explains why everybody's been acting coy to me since 2003<br /><br />Jake: Not coy, it's not coy, they hate you<br /><br />(Penis Anthony Hudson enters)<br /><br />Doobs: Is he dead yet, or is it not that kind of intervention<br /><br />Jake: What kind of interventions do you go to?<br /><br />Doobs: (laughing)<br /><br />Amir: What are you doing here, Doobs?<br /><br />Doobs: I RSVP'd to this intervention one year ago today, on E-vite<br /><br />Jake: Impossible, I didn't have an E-vite for this intervention, I just decided to have it last week.<br /><br />Amir: So quiet up, Huddy!<br /><br />Doobs: You can't call me that any more, A-Weird. <br /><br />Amir: No!<br /><br />Doobs: Yes!

Who wants 5 liters of piping-hot split pea soup? Or, should I say, shit pee poop? *laughs* No, I'm just jok-oh no! Ah! *falls over, pours soup on face* ARGH! FUCK, IT'S BOILING!<br /><br />Jake: O-oh my god!<br /><br />Amir: AH, IT'S BOILING MY FACE AND NECK! AAH, IT'S SO HOT! AAH!<br /><br />Jake: Hey, alright, I'm going to call 9-1-1, okay?<br /><br />Amir: No, it's not going to do anything! I prank call them all the time!<br /><br />Jake: I'll call it from my phone.<br /><br />Amir: I do it from your phone!<br /><br />Jake: Well, I'll just tell them you legitimately burned your face this time!<br /><br />Amir: I crank-yanked them last night with that exact line! I said, please come, I legitimately burned my face this time! They show up, there's a flaming pile of dog shit on my own apartment stoop. Got 'em good.<br /><br />Jake: ..did you?<br /><br />Amir: Nah, not really. They just left and a huge part of my apartment burned down. Can you do me a favor?<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: I'd like to stay with you in order to recoup from this injury. I need you to be my nurse for a week.<br /><br />Jake: ...no.<br /><br />Amir: What? You already said yes! How could you take it back now?<br /><br />Jake: No, I didn't. I said what.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, what is yes! Why would you want to know what the favor is unless you were going to do it?<br /><br />Jake: To see if I wanted to agree to the favor!<br /><br />Amir: No! Hell no!<br /><br />Jake: Don't tell me what I mean.<br /><br />Amir: This is unreal! This was your soup!<br /><br />Jake: What are you talking about?<br /><br />Amir: I made this soup for you, right? I called you last night and I said, if I brought in leftover split pea soup, would you have some?<br /><br />Jake: And I said no!<br /><br />Amir: Exactly! And then I said, if you're not going to have it, then I'm just not going to bring any in, and you said fine.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, fine as in don't bring in the soup.<br /><br />Amir: No, fine as in yes!<br /><br />Jake: Stop telling me what I mean by shit!<br /><br />Amir: Are you actually yelling at me right now? I feel like I'm being burnt alive in a cauldron, or a bowl of hot soup was dumped on my face.<br /><br />Jake: Have you already forgotten that that is what happened?<br /><br />Amir: *sigh* I'm starting to regret this whole plan.<br /><br />Jake: What plan, man?<br /><br />Amir: I figured if I scalded myself on my most important organ,  my face...<br /><br />Jake: Wrong.<br /><br />Amir: For most people it's heart, for me, it's face.<br /><br />Jake: You're wrong. Go on.<br /><br />Amir: I figured if I doused myself in hot soup, you'd want to bring me in. Show me some tender love and care, y'know? Maybe rent some DVDs from Blockbuster Media. I would even eat some leftover yams that you would offer me. I don't really like yams, but I wouldn't have the heart to tell you.<br /><br />Jake: Well, I'm well aware that you hate yams.<br /><br />Amir: I hate 'em. I hate yams!<br /><br />Jake: Stop saying yams.<br /><br />Amir: ....YAMS.<br /><br />Jake: Look, if you really did this just to recover at my house, if you're that pathetic, lowly, and masochistic, then...y'know what? I almost do feel bad enough to have you...<br /><br />Amir: No, no, I don't want to do it like this. I don't want that pity invite!<br /><br />Jake: What are you talking about? Yes you do! You poured the soup on your face!<br /><br />Amir: This isn't about me.<br /><br />Jake: Yes, it is! Everything's about you! You're the most selfish person I know!<br /><br />Amir: That is not fair.<br /><br />Jake: Unfair? You prank called 9-1-1! You took emergency responders away from people who actually need it!<br /><br />Amir: Okay, y'know what? I accept the pity offer. You've made me feel like shit, and so I will accept the pity offer, but I will NOT eat the yams.<br /><br />Jake: Oh, you'll eat the yams.<br /><br />Amir: I will not eat the yams, Amir!<br /><br />Jake: I'M Jake, YOU'RE Amir.<br /><br />Amir: ...YAMS.<br /><br />Jake: *starts strangling AmirAmir: Aah, god, this isn't part of the yam plan!

Your fault. My pants are too tight, and that ain't right.<br /><br />AMIR: I agree. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't respond to your text messages as to whether or not you should buy those pants, but I was with my mom.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, I can't wait to hear this story.  I'm all beers.<br /><br />(Jake mimics opening a beer, drinking it with glug sounds , taking some breaths, drinking again - with more glug sounds - crushing the empty beer can on his forehead and tossing it away.  Jake then laughs at his own joke)<br /><br />AMIR: My mom was in a car accident and so my entire family was with her in the hospital.<br /><br />JAKE: Are you done being a jackass?<br /><br />AMIR: Look, I'm sorry, I don't know what else to say.<br /><br />JAKE: No, no, I'm sorry. Jesus. I'm sorry. <br /><br />AMIR: Thank you.<br /><br />JAKE: What a tragedy.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's just so weird to see this - <br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, no, I can't believe a modern hospital wouldn't have cell phone service. I - I - I - I - I - I'm appalled.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh? No, it had cell phone service.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, it HAD cell phone service.  But you didn't respond to my text, so, your lies are catching up with you, Blumenfeld.  Hmm, I don't know.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I had cell phone reception, I jus-<br /><br />JAKE: How you gonna play this one, bud?<br /><br />AMIR: I just couldn't respond, okay, because I was-<br /><br />JAKE: Cuz you were busy operating on her?  Cuz you're a PA or some shit? Are you a physician's assistant?  Or were you in the waiting room with your dick in your hand?<br /><br />AMIR: I was in the waiting room, yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Then you had your dick in your hand, didn't you?<br /><br />AMIR: No, I didn't have my dick in my - <br /><br />JAKE: You were jerkin' your gerkin in the waiting room. <br /><br />AMIR: No, I was not.<br /><br />JAKE: I bet a doctor would frown upon that.  I do.<br /><br />AMIR: I was on my phone, okay? I was starting this phone tree, you know, trying to alert every member of my family as to what happened.<br /><br />JAKE: You have got to be SHITTING me with that, dude!  You were on your phone? You were on your phone??  And you were ignoring my texts as they're coming in??  By the way, a phone tree works like this: You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know what to say.  I guess I got punked.  It's just that I'm also in emotional pain, too, right now, man.<br /><br />JAKE:  Don't play that card, you coward.  Okay, I sent you 12 pictures of myself in a dressing room, and it would've taken 3 seconds out of your day to give me a hell to the no. You know, even, going forward, how about if you ignore my texts, I'll know, don't buy the cords.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, I ignored the text.<br /><br />JAKE:  Going forward, I said.  As in starting now, and seeing as though I texted you yesterday, Lucy! You got some 'splaining to do!  (to the office) If anybody heard that and didn't laugh, I urge you to reconsider.  Okay, I would take a pity laugh to save some face.  Speaking of face, why is nobody sucking on my face as I am looking amazing in these ill-fitting - slim-fitting! - cords?<br /><br />AMIR: I thought you said you didn't like the pants.<br /><br />JAKE: You thought wrong.  A pair of roys for this lazy goy make the Jewish sluts say oy oy oy.<br /><br />AMIR: Offensive.<br /><br />JAKE: I butt-fucked my brother, on a booze cruise!<br /><br />AMIR: Can't you just return the corduroys? <br /><br />JAKE: Of course I could. It's not exactly how I went to spend my Sunday afternoon, right, bud?<br /><br />(Amir's cell phone rings)<br /><br />AMIR:  The hospital's calling me.<br /><br />JAKE: And once again, you choose them over me.<br /><br />AMIR: I haven't picked it up yet.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, but I know you're thinking about it, dude.  And tell you what, if you pick that up, (in a bit of an accent) me and you are done professionally.  (to the office) Another joke for everybody, that's Christian Ball [sic], (to Amir) but really? Pick it up, and we're not friends.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. (to phone) Hey, can I call you back? (Amir hangs up)<br /><br />(Jake gives Amir a look.  Amir gives him a look back.) <br /><br />JAKE: Oh - oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah, that doesn't matter at all.  You still picked it up!<br /><br />AMIR: I hung up on them!<br /><br />JAKE: You c- you certainly did not.  You left this conversation, you had another one! Ok?  How do you think that makes me feel?<br /><br />AMIR: I told them I'd call them back!<br /><br />JAKE: You s- you uh ew ah - please! You answered the phone, you said (in a high voice, but not in an imitation of Amir's high voice) Hi, how are you? I'm Amir Blumenfeld, I'm a piece of shit. <br /><br />AMIR: No!<br /><br />JAKE: Then you said, (again, in a high voice) can I please call you back? Let me please call you back?  I bet you do call them back, too!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I might.  Probably, yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, man, alright, we have to figure this shit out, ok? I'm sorry your mom's dead, but that's not - <br /><br />AMIR:  She's not dead.<br /><br />JAKE: You gotta be SHITTING me with that!<br /><br />",

So we're on the same generational level. So why don't I give you a list? I'll give you a family tree and you give me a pre-approved list of what I can call you and what I cannot. Daddy: X. Mommy: X. Bro: Okay, that's fine. Cuz: That's fine. So everything on my generational level is fine.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm angry? You're about to leave!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I'm gonna leave. You made me uncomfortable. You made it weird.<br /><br />AMIR: Because it s- it was not even sexual.<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) Wow. Really? Right now you're gonna say- Oh God. Dude, I didn't think it was. Don't make it a sexual thing.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) I guess now it grosses you out because you think it's a sexual thing. (In a mocking sexy tone) Give Daddy a bite. Give Daddy a bite. I wasn't even saying it like-<br /><br />JAKE: You saying that makes it kind of a sexual thing.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) What? Because I'm saying it's not a thing makes it a thing? Okay. So, this is not a computer. I guess that makes it a computer. Is that how it works?<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) No, I'm not trying to put that on you. Oh my God. Just...Drop it. Just drop it.<br /><br />JAKE: Why don't you just drop it?<br /><br />AMIR: (Drops a coin) I want to drop it but you're turning this into a bigger deal than it already is!<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) You're harping on it!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Look at the veins in your neck coming out right now.<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) Oh my God. Veins in my neck. Ooo. Wow. They're gay too. I guess you're freaked out by them because they're calling you daddy. <br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) You always get so stressed out. Just- Dude, just let it go.<br /><br />JAKE: You said something that offended me and I'm gonna leave. That's it.<br /><br />AMIR: So you're going to leave?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, I'm going to leave<br /><br />AMIR: (Overlapping) You're just going to take off for the rest of the day because I called you a nickname? How's that going to work? (Mimic being on the phone) Oh sorry, I'm going to work from home today. Yeah. Amir called me a thing. I guess I'm freaked out and I don't want to be here anymore. If that freaks you out. If that little amount of stuff freaks you out then maybe you shouldn't be here maybe you shouldn't be at work. Because in this environment people call each other nicknames all the time!<br /><br />JAKE: (Overlapping) Yes. I think I'm going to go home. I'll work-I'll work from home. I'll email everyone and say I'm working from home. Not a thing, you called yourself daddy. Shut up dude. Yeah! Maybe I will leave! I'm going to leave. You know what I'm going to do-<br /><br />JAKE: With the yelling, you can stop it right now. I'm going to go home. I've lost my appetite. You don't get the sandwich. I'm gonna throw it away. Where is it?<br /><br />AMIR: (With sandwich bite in mouth) I got it.<br /><br />JAKE: How?<br /><br />AMIR: (Still with bite and sunglasses on over glasses) I guess Daddy wins!<br /><br />JAKE: You're not even chewing it.<br /><br />THE END<br /><br />",

      "script": "[Intro]<br /><br />Jake: Hey! Happy new year! You're watching Jake and Amir.<br /><br />Amir: 2011 y'all!<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />[intro]<br /><br />[Jake and Amir sitting at their desks, Amir starts to dose off]<br /><br />Jake: Hey can you not fall asleep right now? We need to talk about that disgusting habit that you've picked up.<br /><br />Amir: It's called butt chugging, and last time I checked, it wasn't disgusting.<br /><br />Jake: Really? Have you checked recently? Because according to the news story that I saw, it involves sticking a funnel inside your asshole, and ingesting alcohol through your colon.<br /><br />Amir [unfolding a scroll]: Top ten wines to butt chug!<br /><br />Jake [interrupting]: Where do you go scroll shopping? Did you raid an ancient pirate ship or something?<br /><br />Amir: By Amir [long bleep is heard and Amir's mouth is censored] Blumenfeld.<br /><br />Jake: How about you never say that again in the office.<br /><br />Amir [reading off the scroll]: Number ten! I'll say it again. If the taste is heinous, shove it up your anus! you'll get drunk better, faster, stronger.<br /><br />Jake: That is what you did last night at my new year's party, but do you think you were drunker better than anybody? because I think you should up blackout drunk at seven P.M., in half a tuxedo, just the top half, you were naked waist down. You had a glass champagne flute stuck inside your butt, and you were dancing around singing \"happy new queer\".<br /><br />Amir: Number nine, that's wine and dine! A Chardonnay and a fish fillet, blend it up, dinner and a drink, now that won't stink.<br /><br />Jake: You're talking about shoving blended fish inside your butt, then yeah I bet it does.<br /><br />Amir: To each, her own.<br /><br />Number eight, it must be fate. A Zinfandel for this infidel make me think, don't ask, do tell. I stick a funnel in my butt.<br /><br />Jake: We all know what you do, ok? You ruined New Year's. When everybody was counting down you bent over and farted Vodka onto the TV.<br /><br />Amir: I'm the life and death, of every party.<br /><br />Jake: Yeah you definitely killed the mood when you slipped and fell and shattered that glass Champagne flute inside your body. We took you to the hospital but the doctor refused to operate on you. He said, in the long run it might be better if you just die.<br /><br />Amir: Number seven, is Levant. That's right, I soak a full body bread in a Jewish rye bread, and this ass, gets fed. Aka, you freeze the loaf and chisel off little suppositories that you stick inside your ass all night like little Tic-Tacs.<br /><br />Jake: Is that what you do with Tic-Tacs?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: Why?<br /><br />Amir: Number six, it's for dicks! Take a Capri-Sun straw and stick it in your urethra. With a reverse piss, you can't miss.<br /><br />Jake: So you graduated to dick chugging?<br /><br />Amir: With honors, sir.<br /><br />Amir: Number five, P. nomwar? More like p. yes. - Lar.<br /><br />Jake: Woah.<br /><br />Amir: Woah<br /><br />Jake: Bad.<br /><br />Amir [disappointed]: Oh.<br /><br />Jake: Terrible rhyme.<br /><br />Amir: No?<br /><br />Jake: How did that make your final draft?<br /><br />Amir: It didn't.<br /><br />Jake: This isn't a final? Why are you reading it in front of me?<br /><br />Amir: Number four. One Tequila, two Tequila, three Tequila, sore. Ow, if your anus ain't bruised all night, then you ain't funnelin' right.<br /><br />Jake: Is there a right way to funnel? If there is, I bet you don't know it. 'Cause why else do you have those shards of glass inside your anal cavity right now?<br /><br />Amir: Number three, you and me. Sippin' on some English tea.<br /><br />Jake: So not butt chugging.<br /><br />Amir: Oh, no, no, no. We're sipping it through our assholes.<br /><br />Jake: Definitely not doing that with you.<br /><br />Amir: Number two, how about some Yoo-hoo where you poo-poo. That's right, it's already wet and brown downtown, mamma mia, that's some diarrhea!<br /><br />Jake: I think what I'm gonna do is e-mail Paul...<br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: ...and ugh, see if I have the permission to send you home, or if he will. Um, you need to not be here today.<br /><br />Amir: How is that your call to make?<br /><br />Jake: I'm gonna tell him the circumstances and see if I can send you home.<br /><br />Amir: That's so illogical to me.<br /><br />Jake: Really?<br /><br />Amir: Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: That's illogical? 'Cause I think getting your anus wounds untreated, leaving the hospital saying: \"Fuck this quack, you're a hack\", I think that's illogical.<br /><br />Amir: Not fair.<br /><br />Jake: That's not fair? What you're doing to your body isn't fair.<br /><br />Amir: I'm almost done with the list.<br /><br />Jake: Three of your top ten haven't even been alcohol. One of them involved shoving a straw inside your dick. I mean that's self-mutilation bud, and I think all of them will kill you.<br /><br />Amir: Number one, have some fun in the sun hun. Bring your ass to the beach, and flop it down like a leech. Put your knees by your ears, but don't feed your butt beers. Not Vodka nor Gin, no those can't go in. Spread your butt cheeks wide, stick that funnel inside, now wait for the tide you're going for a ride. You're a full grown guy, with a tight brown eye, so make sure your lips are sealed, and your rectum is peeled. Which alcohol is best, for your asshole that stretch? Not red nor white, nor Captain Morgan's Delight, no. What will save the day? Oh you don't say? it's: drum roll please.<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: A simple Rose.<br /><br />[Jake start clapping slowly]<br /><br />Amir: Thank you.<br /><br />Jake: I don't mean it. Are you done with the list?<br /><br />Amir: Not 'till I celebrate, [takes out a glass of blended fish and alcohol, and a funnel], with a number nine.<br /><br />Jake: Please not now, not here at the office.<br /><br />[Amir starts pouring the drink into the funnel, and looks in pain].<br /><br />Jake: Oh no! Ah!<br /><br />Amir [in pain]: Ah! It's in me.<br /><br />",

That's fine.<br /><br />STELLA: So sad.<br /><br />GUY: Jake, can we just play?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, sorry,<br /><br />AMIR: Wait, before you guys start...<br /><br />JAKE: So you're talking right off the bat.<br /><br />AMIR: It's a question.  I wanna ask a question.<br /><br />JAKE: Did you talk it? Because I said no talking.<br /><br />AMIR: You mean did you speak it.  You can't talk it, you don't say did can talk it, you moron.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a moron.<br /><br />AMIR: Does anyone want sandwiches?  There.  That's my question.  God forbid I ask it!<br /><br />GUY: I'll take a sandwich.<br /><br />STELLA: Yeah.<br /><br />STREETER: Sure, I'll take one.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh what a surprise, Streeter wants a sandwich.  Oh wait, that's not a surprise.  The way he's bigger than anyone else is that he eats sandwiches more frequently than the average person.<br /><br />S: Come on!<br /><br />AMIR: Ten dollars, everybody give me ten dollars.<br /><br />JAKE: So you're not buying them.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm BUYING them.  I just don't want to PAY FOR THEM, you grammar Nazi.  Who here thinks I'm right?<br /><br />(Stella raises her hand)<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />AMIR: I like word play.  I've always been the kind of girl who's been like Hmmm, I don't know, CAN you go to the bathroom? Heh.<br /><br />AMIR: I like this one.  Her skin's a little greasy and her eyebrows are WAY too thick, but she's fun, and I think she likes me, too.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, you were just narrating that entire thing.<br /><br />AMIR: It was then that I realized I was narrating along the entire time.  Did the grease princess hear what I had to say about her eyebrows.  We may never know?<br /><br />STELLA: Yeah, I did.<br /><br />AMIR: My mind was racing.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, let's just play.  Uh, Stella, you're small blinds.  Streeter, you're big.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, he is very big.<br /><br />JAKE: You know what dude, that's enough, you can go home.  Cuz  I said no talking, and if anything, you're talking more than you usually do.  You seem incapable of even having an internal monologue.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, give me one more chance!  Give me one more chance!  If I make one joke that makes everybody here crack the fuck up, then I get to stay and play.<br /><br />JAKE: Why would I agree to that?<br /><br />AMIR: Because if I don't, if my joke falls flat, then I will leave you alone for the rest of your life.<br /><br />JAKE: (Beat) Wow.  Sure, yeah.  I'll take that.  Go ahead.<br /><br />AMIR: (singing) When there's something gay in your neighborhood, who you gonna call?

We are reporting live from Ace's closet. It sounds like Ace has [Amir presses his ear to the door, hears moaning] some sort of girl over, but I'm sure they won't mind we... interrupt.<br /><br />[Amir opens the closet door and walks out. The camera is pointed at the floor.]<br /><br />JAKE: [panicked] Wh-whoa whoa hey hey-<br /><br />[Cut to the opening credits. Jake and Amir are both dancing, and text vaguely matching the lyrics flashes on screen in time to the song.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ace and Jocelyn, Ace and Jocelyn, from space and Jocelyn! Astronaut accountants and they're comin' to your face!

Jake and Amir are inside.]<br /><br />AMIR: We're in trouble, Ace! Earth's closest planet, the moon, needs us.<br /><br />[Pan to Jake, who is not wearing a shirt.]<br /><br />JAKE: Dude, were you really just taping me right now? <br /><br />AMIR: I'm always taping you, Ace! I'm always taping you.<br /><br />[During the ensuing argument, a drawing of a woman who is riding a phallic rocket and has had Amir's face crudely edited on to her floats by and obscures the video.]<br /><br />JAKE: Okay-- well, I-- you know what? Give me the camera, alright? 'Cuz I  need to-- erase that-- footage...<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] No! Get off of me! What are you doing? Oh, your hands smell like Vaseline!<br /><br />[The camera turns, and Jake is wrestling Amir for control of the camera. The frame rotates away in a transition to a skyline shot.]<br /><br />AMIR: The city looks so calm... but it's in trouble, Ace.<br /><br />JAKE: I thought you said the moon was in trouble.<br /><br />AMIR: Will you just play along? Okay? You already did the dance, y--<br /><br />[cut]<br /><br />JAKE: Jocelyn! If--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: --If I go on this space mission with you, if we can save the city, then... [Amir briefly jerks the camera to face him, then back to Jake] you promise you'll let me... delete the footage of me touching my idea... stick, right? To get the enemy intelligence!<br /><br />AMIR: It's too obvious! It's too obvious.<br /><br />[The frame page-curls away. Jake and Amir are now walking down the street.]<br /><br />JAKE: All right, Jocelyn. What's the plan?<br /><br />AMIR: The plan is there's a nuclear reactor down by the river. I say we go down there, and try to defuse it!<br /><br />JAKE: Great idea, but... pretty cold down there. You sure the reactor's not indoors somewhere?<br /><br />AMIR: It's not indoors! It's outdoors. Okay? Stick to the script, and you will go there in a T-shirt for this insubordination!<br /><br />JAKE: Dude, relax!<br /><br />AMIR: Unless you want me to leak the footage of you jer--<br /><br />[The frame star-wipes to Jake and Amir at the riverside.]<br /><br />JAKE: Here we are at the river, and, uh... fortunately, there's no nuclear reactor, so I guess we should, uh...<br /><br />AMIR: No no no, it's probably... at the bottom of the river. You should go in and check it out.<br /><br />JAKE: Aaah, no. Dammit, we're... we're foiled, 'cuz... the river is too... frigid, and... polluted and filthy to... to go in...<br /><br />AMIR: Well clearly you don't have a problem being filthy! Right? I have footage on here that shows you not having a problem being filthy, and I can go back upstairs and friggin' upload it!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? You know what, dude? That's it.

Amir is walking and videotaping his face.]<br /><br />JAKE: [off-screen] Okay, we have to get back to my apartment, now.<br /><br />AMIR: That was epic, man. I totally recorded it-- Oh, shit...<br /><br />[Diamond-wipe to Jake, soaking wet and wrapped up in a blanket in his apartment.]<br /><br />JAKE: Did you get it?<br /><br />AMIR: Uhh, well, good news and bad news, heh: Good news is, you get to jump in the river again! Yay! That was... fun. The bad news is, due to a camera malfunction, the, um... the footage was sort of lost. Not human error--<br /><br />[Jake begins slapping Amir over and over.]<br /><br />AMIR: N-- ow! Stop-- high-fiving my-- face!<br /><br />[Cut. They are still in the apartment.]<br /><br />JAKE: You... definitely deleted that footage, though?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. I'm gonna delete it... Either that, or I'll do you one better!<br /><br />[Amir begins running.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ey-- no. No!<br /><br />[Cut to footage from earlier. Jake is naked with a belt around his neck. There is a censor bar. There is obnoxiously-inserted text throughout.]<br /><br />JAKE: [to the dog] Hey. Go away. Go to your food.<br /><br />TEXT: REMIX IN 3 / 2 / 3 / Dammit / A m i r R u l e z / WONE! / REEE-MIXXX<br /><br />[Jake strangles himself with a belt and jerking off. The footage is remixed into a rudimentary beat of coughs and choking sounds.

The beat and singing continue. Cut forward to Amir walking into the room. Jake sees him, tries to pull up his pants, and falls over.]<br /><br />JAKE: What're you doing here, man--<br /><br />[The episode ends abruptly.]<br /><br />END<br /><br />",

You having a bad birthday?<br /><br />Amir: Bad birthday, nah. Bad you!<br /><br />Jake: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Amir: I've been alive for almost a decade now-<br /><br />Jake: Wrong.<br /><br />Amir: And I have nothing to show for it, save for a few successful business ventures and a lovely wife!<br /><br />Jake: You don't have those things.<br /><br />Amir: Kick me while I'm down why don't you?<br /><br />Jake: Well why all this sadness? Why now?<br /><br />Amir: I just got a letter from myself. Sent to me when I was 12 years old as part of a sixth grade class project where every student was supposed to send a letter to your future self. Turns out, every single student sent a letter to me. Yeah, 28 different letters that all start out with the same sentence: I hope you're not alive to read this.

Well I got one for you, Mr. Bean.<br /><br />Jake: Just read the letter.<br /><br />Amir (Reading): Dear Amir, I hope you're not alive to read this.

Dear Amir, DIE, Go Bills, Love Kyle. <br /><br />Jake: You're adding love to the end of it. <br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: Did you grow up in Buffalo?<br /><br />Amir: Niagara Falls actually. My mom is a French-Canadian queen and my dad is an Army rat. <br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: Mainly a rat coward who went AWOL during his time at Vietnam. Faked his own death now twice but thrice during the span of 18 months and gave away the names and locations of over 1000 of his comrades. <br /><br />Jake: God, what a traitor!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!

He shakes his head about what happened. A waitress comes over.]<br /><br />WAITRESS (CHLOE): How's the steak?<br /><br />AMIR: Fine... though I think I need a martini after that whole exchange.<br /><br />[The waitress chuckles politely.]<br /><br />AMIR: Catch that?<br /><br />WAITRESS: Yup. One martini comin' up!<br /><br />AMIR: No: what happened with me and my friend? Best friend, actually. Or so I thought.<br /><br />WAITRESS: Oh. No.<br /><br />AMIR: He ditch-ditch-ditched me.<br /><br />[The waitress goes to leave, but Amir holds her back by the arm.]<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, one second. Where's the hostess? Let's call her over; she saw the whole thing.<br /><br />WAITRESS: Let go of my arm... and I'll go get her.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine.<br /><br />[He lets go of her arm.]<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, what's her name? I can just call her over.<br /><br />WAITRESS: It's Jessica. I'll just go grab--<br /><br />AMIR: Perfect. Jessica! Jessica!<br /><br />[As Amir calls for the hostess, Jessica, he restrains the waitress by the wrist again. She tries to pull away.]<br /><br />AMIR: You're... hurting my fingers, honestly.<br /><br />[Jessica comes over.]<br /><br />JESSICA: Are you okay?<br /><br />AMIR: Jess! Hi. I was just telling, um...<br /><br />[There is a pause, but not a very long one.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's when you say your name, sweetheart. It's called flirting. [to Jessica] You saw when my best friend left, right? After I told that good joke?<br /><br />JESSICA: ...Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: Look, I knew you thought it was funny, didn't you? For an off-the-cuff one-liner?<br /><br />JESSICA: Um...<br /><br />AMIR: Um what?<br /><br />JESSICA: ...It was fine,<br /><br />AMIR: [in a robot voice] It was fine... No it was not fine... It was good... [speaking normally] Okay, tell it like it is. All right? Obviously I wouldn't Tweet it. I have a very unpopular twitter account: USARice. Follow it if you scare! [imitating Dracula's iconic laugh] Moo ooo ahh ahh ahh...<br /><br />[There is a long pause. Amir holds the Dracula face.]<br /><br />AMIR: DO you honestly think he should have left, though? Over one joke?<br /><br />JESSICA: Well, I kinda get the sense that you make those jokes a lot...<br /><br />AMIR: Granted! Okay? But that's almost enough out of you, so please... proceed with caution.<br /><br />JESSICA: Well maybe he was just fed up, and... didn't want to be here anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: And that actually is enough out of you. Thank you so much, Jessica; you're trying to be nice, but you're giving me a legit migraine right now.<br /><br />JESSICA: Well I also got the sense that he didn't want to be here to begin with, so...<br /><br />AMIR: [mock laughter] It's my birthday today. [pause] Wow, suddenly the customer's always right! I'll have that martini for free now, and as for the steak, I think... no, in fact I know I'm going to be eating it off your ass.<br /><br />[The waitress slaps Amir in the face.]<br /><br />AMIR : Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Woo! Yeah! That's a lawsuit. That is a lawsuit. Good news, everybody! My name's Jake Hurwitz and dinner's on me, because this establishment now owes me a million dollars! In the form of a suit. [tugs his collar] Class action!<br /><br />[The waitress begins crying.]<br /><br />JESSICA: It's fine, Chloe. It's gonna be fine.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, it's fine! It's fine? Or do I have a video tape... of the whole frickin' thing?<br /><br />[Amir holds up his iPhone, which has a recording of him playing.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the iPhone] It's fine? Or do I have a video tape of the whole frickin' thing?<br /><br />AMIR: Nooooo!<br /><br />[Jake comes back to the restaurant.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, man. I'm sorry. I cooled off. It's just I really hate when you make those jokes. You know?<br /><br />[Amir nods.]<br /><br />JAKE: What's going on? Did you make this girl cry?<br /><br />AMIR: I made her realize that she was being a proud little diva tramp floozy!<br /><br />[Jake slaps Amir in the face.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's another lawsuit! That is another lawsuit, unbelievable! Two for the price of fun! I'm rich... James, bitch!<br /><br />END<br /><br />",

Time!<br /><br />Jake: Woah.<br /><br />Amir: Hey.<br /><br />Jake: What was your time?<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: How long was your run? How long did it take you?<br /><br />Amir: Oh, I didn't run.  Took a cab to work; I was just, uh, asking what time it was. [Gestures to watch] 12:19.<br /><br />Jake: 4 PM.<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: It's 4 PM.  That makes you like 6 or 7 hours late today.<br /><br />Amir: 6. Idiot.<br /><br />Jake: I'm not an idiot; you don't know what time work starts.<br /><br />Amir: What do you think my biggest weakness is? Correction: was my biggest weakness is?<br /><br />Jake: You're not smart?<br /><br />Amir: No.<br /><br />Jake: You get angry easily?<br /><br />Amir: No exercise gear, exactly right.<br /><br />Jake: You also seem incapable of going with the flow of a conversation.  You have like some sort of agenda, you're going to make your point no matter what I contribute.<br /><br />Amir: No arm warmer.  No tank.  A lack of zero compression pants.<br /><br />Jake: You had a lack of zero compression pants?<br /><br />Amir: I went to Sports Authority, and I got calm.<br /><br />[brief pause]<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: My life has been a whirlwind ever since Passover. Yeah, my dad gave me a hundred dollar bill to go fuck myself with.  Luckily for me, they accept that at most sporting goods stores. [hits ground while doing a push-up] Ow.<br /><br />Jake: If it's a hundred dollar bill, then they accept it anywhere.<br /><br />Amir [eating from a gel pouch]: Ugh, these things never get any easier to swallow.  Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo!<br /><br />Jake: Have you actually started exercising?<br /><br />Amir: Not yet, I'm a triathlete.  As in, I'm trying to be an athlete.<br /><br />Jake: By buying those clothes?<br /><br />Amir [doing the macarena]: They say to dress for the job you want.  And I want a blow job.<br /><br />Jake: You know, that's not even a stretch, that's the macarena.  You can leave, or you can get to work.<br /><br />Amir: I'm actually pretty depressed about all this shit.  I feel like I can't get my act together at all.<br /><br />Jake:  Cool, man, I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you want me to say?<br /><br />Amir: I spent the better part of a G of not my own money trying to make my old man proud.  Turns out the only thing he could be proud of, is that his son is a piece of shit.<br /><br />Jake: Why would he be proud of that?<br /><br />Amir: I like to make people laugh, you know?  Except the only problem is I'm the only joke in this room.  And what's so funny about a grown-ass loser?<br /><br />Jake: I guess it's funny that you're having this realization in compression pants.<br /><br />Amir: That's true. <br /><br />Jake: No, man, I was making fun of you.<br /><br />Amir: Thanks, man.  I needed to hear that.<br /><br />Jake: Don't thank me, I was being mean to you.<br /><br />Amir: Hey, everybody: get a load of these pants.<br /><br />[crowd which has suddenly materialized begins laughing]<br /><br />Amir: Oppa gangnam style!<br /><br />[everyone laughs harder]<br /><br />[Amir begins dancing and crowd starts to applaud and cheer]<br /><br />[Jake, smiling happily, claps twice and points a finger to the sky]<br /><br />[All Gold Everything by Trinidad James can be heard playing]<br /><br />Amir dressed as blonde woman [in Southern accent]: I want to give you the job you want: a blow job.<br /><br />[transition to Amir, semi-conscious and dancing, sitting up against some garbage cans on a sidewalk]<br /><br />Amir: Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo!<br /><br />[Jake and a Police Officer approach]<br /><br />Jake: Yeah, that's him.<br /><br />Police Officer: We found him passed out outside of a Sports Authority shouting obscenities at strangers.<br /><br />Jake: Is he dead?<br /><br />Police Officer: Unfortunately, no.

I know, cuz I've lost 6 other Iphones to that cruel mistress.<br /><br />(to GIRL #7)<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, if you think this is sad, you should read my diary.

And I hope it bites you on your filthy, little ass. Just like your father did to me with his tiny, spindly, little legs.<br /><br />JAKE: Your dad bit him on the ass with his legs?<br /><br />USHER: Jakey, jakey eggs and stupid! No, no, no. Just because those lips are super good at (mimic eating a dick) munching down on some d, doesn't mean they can ask questions. There will be a Question and Answer at the end. No more questions. Ever again. I have a question.<br /><br />DOOBS: Yes, you. The bell hop.<br /><br />USHER: How thin are Amir's father's legs?<br /><br />DOOBS: Nightmare-ishly thin. 3 centimeters in diameter. No bones, just blood and skin. He wrapped them around my waist like a limp garden hose and no matter how hard I struggled to get free, he'd put them tighter and tighter like a boa constrictor. Or worse still, a garden snake! You know, I still have dreams about them. <br /><br />AMIR: Nightmares?<br /><br />DOOBS: No, A-smears, dreams.<br /><br />USHER: Would you like a snack?<br /><br />DOOBS: I'd love one.<br /><br />USHER: Up.<br /><br />DOOBS: Alley-oop<br /><br />(Candy hits Jake in the face again)<br /><br />JAKE: Ow.<br /><br />USHER: Ladies and gentlemen, to the 3 people in the audience and the dozens and dozens of people who refused to show up-<br /><br />DOOBS: Sold out!<br /><br />USHER: We present to you a movie that will rock the mushroom off your dick!<br /><br />DOOBS: And the shaft!<br /><br />USHER: And the veins!<br /><br />DOOBS: And the sack!<br /><br />USHER: And the balls!<br /><br />DOOBS: And the pussies.<br /><br />USHER: We present to you,<br /><br />USHER and DOOBS: Silver Linings Gay-book<br /><br />USHER: Starring<br /><br />USHER and DOOBS: Bradley Pooper<br /><br />USHER: And one<br /><br />USHER and DOOBS: Penis Scarlett Johansson Anal.

That's not the issue.<br /><br />Amir: Why wear something that people can only compliment sarcastically?<br /><br />Jake: I missed a spot, I missed one spot, so I said 'fuck it, I'll go with a chinner'<br /><br />Amir: A chinner?<br /><br />Jake: Winner Winner Chicken Chinner, yeah! Any questions?<br /><br />Amir: Why did you do it?<br /><br />Jake: Not a question.<br /><br />Amir: Yeah it is.<br /><br />Jake: Here's a science fact: Chicks dig scars. Or was Ice Cube at the 'Are We There Yet' cast  crew after-party sponsored by Voss Water not stylin'?<br /><br />Amir:  Do chicks dig chin strap beards?<br /><br />Jake: Does it matter? 'Cause I can shave it off. Also, it was a joke! I build up a defensive wall so thick you can't get through it with dynamite.  How's that for insecure?<br /><br />Amir:  I respect you so much but sometimes you make me really sad for you.<br /><br />Jake: A chin strap for this thin chap make the fat booty go clap. I made out with my nephew. At a house party.<br /><br />Amir: Sorry, what?<br /><br />Jake:  I get invited to house parties, is what I'm saying.<br /><br />Amir: You kissed-You have a, wait- You have a nephew?<br /><br />Jake: He's a little twerp.  Him and his friends beat the shit out of me and pissed on my jeans.<br /><br />Amir: What, because of your beard?<br /><br />Jake: Chin strap. No. I crashed their party and I was j-<br /><br />Amir: So you weren't invited?<br /><br />Jake: To their house party? No.<br /><br />Amir: You said you get invited to house parties.<br /><br />Jake: Not that one! I get invited to other house parties. I wasn't invited to this one. I get invited to other house parties, ok? Anyway I show up, I'm jackin' all the poon,  they come up to me and they're like 'uh uh dude, you weren't invited, and we're 16'<br /><br />Amir: And then you made out with him?<br /><br />Jake:  A little bit, yeah! And I obviously forgot to mention that I was <br /><br />Robotripping.<br /><br />Amir: Robotripping?<br /><br />Jake: It's called you polish off a bottle of  Robitussin, you wash it down with two pumps of capri sun. I would eat dog shit if Bradley Cooper did it in Limitless.<br /><br />[Enter Murphy]<br /><br />Murphy: Hey Jake, can I borrow your copy of Limitless?<br /><br />Jake: Dude, I'm shaving it.<br /><br />Murphy: What are you talking about?<br /><br />Jake: This chin strap, it's obviously a goof, I'm shaving it as we squeak.<br /><br />Murphy: I don't know man, I think it looks pretty cool.<br /><br />Jake:  So do I. It does make me look quite 'strapping'<br /><br />Murphy: Haha, uh, I was joking. It sucks.<br /><br />Jake: Dude, I was joking too.  Haha. Tell me what to think.  Honestly, because I'll pull the hair out right now if you say the word.<br /><br />Pat Cassels:  Jesus, Jake, why are you insecure?<br /><br />Amir: He's not, ok, it's called Robotripping! Have you ever done it? No, probably not because you're too scared to even eat dog shit!<br /><br />Murphy: Are you crying?<br /><br />Jake: Dude, he for real! I made out with my nephew.<br /><br />Amir: He did. At a house party.<br /><br />Jake: House party. Tell them where it was, dude.<br /><br />Amir: He kissed him at a house party.<br /><br />Murphy: You're both crying so much!<br /><br />Jake: We're beefing.<br /><br />Amir: We're beefing.<br /><br />Jake: We're beefing.<br /><br />Amir: We're beefing.<br /><br />Jake: We beef.<br /><br />",

You like my underwear?<br /><br />Jake: That's your penis.<br /><br />Amir: Alright.<br /><br />Episode<br /><br />(Amir is smoking a hookah, when Jake comes into the office)<br /><br />Amir: Mm. Hit?<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Come over.<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Smoking a hookah.<br /><br />Jake: I see that.<br /><br />Amir: Not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Jake: You know, it's actually not, but clearly think it is. Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten to work, set up the entire hookah, and <br /><br />then waited for me to get here so you could ask me to smoke with you.<br /><br />(Amir moves his mouth as if he's blowing smoke rings)<br /><br />Jake: Nothing's coming out of your mouth so you're definitely not blowing smoke rings.<br /><br />Amir: Don't blow smoke up my ass.<br /><br />Jake: I don't think that's lit, man.<br /><br />Amir: I have strawberry. I have strawberry and apple and watermelon and mint, and mint is the bomb, and it's smooth, and if you mix it <br /><br />with strawberry it tastes like a mojito.<br /><br />Jake: Why do you think this is cool?<br /><br />Amir: Why is drinking alcohol cool? Hm? Why is riding on a motorcyle cool? Why is wearing SPF of less than 10 at the beach cool?<br /><br />Jake: I don't that think that is cool.<br /><br />Amir: Because it's dangerous! Being safe is for mothers and nerds, and last time I checked, I'm have a pussy.<br /><br />Jake: ...what?!<br /><br />Amir: I said I don't have a pussy!<br /><br />Jake: No you didn't! You didn't say that! You said I'm have a pussy!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah!<br /><br />Jake: Have you even done any work at all today?<br /><br />Amir: (Holding up the hookah hose) Yeah.<br /><br />Jake: So setting up the hookah was your work.<br /><br />Amir: No, I also did regular work.<br /><br />Jake: Where's your computer? It's not out.<br /><br />Amir: (Holding up his backpack, from which mewing can be heard) It's in my fricking backpack!<br /><br />Jake: Is there a fucking cat in there with it?!<br /><br />Amir: Chill it with this line of questioning, okay! It's not becoming of either of us. You're stressing me out.<br /><br />Jake: Your computer's not out, it's not on; you haven't done any work at all.<br /><br />Amir: I've been checking my Gmail on my work phone.<br /><br />Jake: You have a work phone?<br /><br />Amir: (Mocking Jake) Yeah I have a work phone.<br /><br />Jake: Where's your phone?<br /><br />Amir: (Opening his backpack) It's here.<br /><br />Jake: In the bag.<br /><br />Amir: (Brandishing his phone) Yeah, in the bag.<br /><br />Jake: How are you checking it?<br /><br />(Amir shakes his head idly)<br /><br />Jake: Gimme your phone.<br /><br />(Amir tosses Jake his phone)<br /><br />Amir: Careful, it's dirty!<br /><br />Jake: It smells like soy sauce and yoghurt!<br /><br />Amir: Yeah, the lock screen is all... messed up. It's like—<br /><br />Jake: Not the lock screen. All the buttons are just stuck together, it's one giant button. You ruined your phone.<br /><br />Amir: I'm starting to not even be in the mood to smoke.<br /><br />Jake: Stop trying so hard.<br /><br />Amir: Why? Huh? Because you shouldn't try to be cool! You should just be yourself and not care what other people think?<br /><br />Jake: Yes.<br /><br />Amir: No! No, absolutely not! Last week, I paid 2000 dollars for a getting-with-chicks seminar. And guess what happened: final exam <br /><br />time rolls around and we're at a bar, and every single one of us hooks up with a girl. That's right: we all made out like bandits. And <br /><br />on my way home, guess what I saw: the teacher of the class, Sean, he was discreetly paying every single girl that made out with us <br /><br />nerds money. And you know why?<br /><br />Jake: Because he hired whores to french you so you'd feel better about yourself!<br /><br />Amir: Because I'm cool!<br /><br />Jake: You know, with two grand you probably could have paid girls to do a lot more than just make out with you.<br /><br />Amir: What.<br /><br />",

I don't wanna do this chore!'\"<br /><br />JAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three:\"<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit...<br /><br />AMIR: \"...fireworks for me!

[to Jake] You chose the wrong bull to tangle with, compende? [to nobody in particular] Okay, here we go: selfie for the Insta! [takes a picture of himself with the bag] Hashtag... hashbag.<br /><br />JAKE: Where did you even get these plastic handcuffs?<br /><br />AMIR: I'll ask the questions here. [pause] Ace Hardware.<br /><br />JAKE: You just answered my question.<br /><br />AMIR: They're gonna throw the book at you, you know that? And you know what else? I'm gonna let 'em! 'Cause I have a lot of pull in this court system-- don't ask me how or why.<br /><br />JAKE: How and why?<br /><br />AMIR: A judge ran over my face when I was six! Want to know the saddest part?<br /><br />JAKE: That you survived.<br /><br />AMIR: That I used to respect you. And now I know the truth about you... you're a drug.<br /><br />JAKE: It's a little bit of weed! ...You loser!<br /><br />AMIR: If I'm a loser, then I'm the biggest loser! Because truth be bold, I've got a quota to hit this month, and I am very much so under! Ever heard of bein' on thin ice? Well it is springtime, my friend, and I am swimmin' in the shit! I guess you could say I'm up Shit's Creek... with a paddle.<br /><br />ROSIE: Hey... enough. Enough.<br /><br />AMIR: Holy shit, you must be dumber than you look. I gave you a get-out-of-jail-free tard and you're throwin' it back in my face!<br /><br />ROSIE: ...It's oregano.<br /><br />JAKE AND AMIR: [simultaneously] What?<br /><br />ROSIE: I've been... sellin' to Jake for two years; he says the stuff gets him really fucked-up.

Jake quietly spits out the food he was chewing onto the plate in disgust. Amir scoffs.]<br /><br />AMIR: [still quietly] Oh my God...<br /><br />[Jake stares daggers at Amir. Streeter puts down the sandwich he had been eating for lunch. He folds his glasses up and buries his head in his hands.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Yeah? You can't--<br /><br />[Streeter shakes his head. Amir scoffs again.]<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] ...What?<br /><br />[Amir makes a gun shape with his hand, points it at his head, and pantomimes shooting himself. Jake nods and mouths \"do it\". Amir looks dejected, and halfheartedly attempts to chuckle. Streeter is still sitting in silence, and Jake pats Streeter's shoulder to console him. Amir attempts to do the same, but Streeter swats his hand away and then gets up and leaves. Amir and Jake are left at the table together.]<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] You think that's... appropriate?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Boiling hot spum\"?<br /><br />END",

Some choice pieces at first, but then we'd build up our inventory, start franchising some stores?<br /><br />JAKE: How is that a get rich quick scheme? Sounds like that would take years.<br /><br />[Amir puts his hand on Jake's shoulder.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's the first smart thing you've said today.<br /><br />[Amir has his arm around Jake so tightly that he's pressing his cheek against Jake's shoulder.]<br /><br />JAKE: Don't touch me, dude.

I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!<br /><br />JAKE: That's actually really smart--<br /><br />AMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis!

Hey Jake, the butler did it! They're Final Four bound. And gagged!<br /><br />Jake: You crossed them out.<br /><br />Amir: What?<br /><br />Jake: You don't have Butler, you crossed them out.

Nothing but a public urination ticket and a slap on the wrist. That's not fair.<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Amir: Whoah, great news! In your world, iTunes just launched, that's a great investment opportunity!<br /><br />Jake: I'll change the pick!<br /><br />Amir: Why would you? I'm sure the Governator, you know Arnold Schwarzenegger, the new governor of California would endorse your pick, especially if he just got finished watching Finding Nemo, the new Pixar flick that just came out!<br /><br />Jake: How do you know so much about 2003?!<br /><br />Amir: How do you know so little about basketball?!<br /><br />Jake: You still have MICKEY MOUSE winning it all!<br /><br />Amir: That's because he's a diva little mousey bitch!",

We'll rent a movie: The Bjorn (Bourne) Identity, starring Jason Bjorn (Bourne)?<br /><br />Jake: It's actually starring Matt Damon.<br /><br />Amir: Oh yeah, the guy from Outbreak, with the airbjorn (airborne) illness.<br /><br />Jake: You're thinking of Contagion now.<br /><br />Amir: Guess what my favorite tennis player is.<br /><br />Jake: BjÃ¶rn Borg.<br /><br />Amir: Patrick.. Rafter. ...He was a bjorn (born) winner.<br /><br />Jake: Stop saying \"bjorn.\" You know what? I'm calling the police. I feel like I've been doing this way too much recently.<br /><br />Amir: You're gonna look like such a fool when they get here.<br /><br />Jake: (on phone) Doubtful.<br /><br />[A cop enters near Amir.]<br /><br />Cop: There he is.<br /><br />Jake: (lowers phone) Wow, they didn't even need to pick up. Sir, I can and will testify against this.. criminal.<br /><br />Cop: Let me see those hands.<br /><br />Jake: You heard the man.<br /><br />Cop: So I can shake them.<br /><br />Jake: What?<br /><br />Cop: Permission to congratulate the hero that saved my son's life.<br /><br />Amir: (pause, inhales) Denied.<br /><br />Cop: (nods) Understood.<br /><br />Jake: What's going on right now?<br /><br />Cop: I was walking my child to daycare when I heard gunfire. A lot of people were dying, and I froze. But this brave, brave man stepped forward and took my son off my hands so I could apprehend a murderer.<br /><br />Jake: You sure he didn't just take advantage of the situation in order to steal your baby?<br /><br />Cop: WOW. Permission to kick this man's ass, sir.<br /><br />Amir: Denied. Denied.<br /><br />Jake: I just got this text message from him five minutes ago. \"Hey dude, jacked a baby on the way to work. This is gonna be hilarious. From a cop, no less. A little piggy.\"<br /><br />Cop: Let me see that.<br /><br />Jake: Sure thing. Yeah, you know what, in fact, anything I can do to help. I always wanted to be a police officer myself, and uh, I guess this makes it official!Hey! Come on... [The cop crushes Jake's phone.] God...<br /><br />Cop: (hands remains to Jake) Now it doesn't say anything.<br /><br />Jake: Holy crap, that was so!that was, like, insanely easy for you, huh? You are strong as shit. This is like!that's a 4 so that's a heavier phone, there's a steel band, I mean!holy wow, that is...<br /><br />Cop: Permission to hug my son again, sir. Permission to squeeze his rosy cheeks.<br /><br />Amir: Oh! You wanna.. squeeze these cheeks, huh? These, uh!this cute little face, this chunky munchkin little grapefruit guy, huh? You wanna squeeze this little squeezeball? (laughs)<br /><br />Cop: Yes, very much so.<br /><br />Amir: Denied.<br /><br />Cop: You are the boss of me. (salutes) [The baby makes a \"goo\" sound as Amir squeezes his cheeks.]<br /><br />Jake: Dude... go take your son back. [The cop puts Jake in an armlock.] HEY! OW! AH!<br /><br />Cop: Permission to break this perp's arm, sir!<br /><br />Jake: (in pain) I'm not a perp! Deny him! Deny him!<br /><br />Amir: (moving baby's mouth to match his words) ...Granted.<br /><br />Jake: NO...!<br /><br />Cop: NYAHHH!!! (breaks Jake's arm)<br /><br />Jake: AHHH!!!<br /><br />THE END",

Har, har, har!<br /><br />Jake: I'm not trying to be clever; it looks like you cut open a dead rat. Maybe it was alive when you did it, and then you filled it with bloody money.<br /><br />Amir: (in a British accent) Bloody money! Bloody money! You're not British, man! [Pause, then Jake pushes Amir.] OH! [Jake grabs Amir.] AH! [Jake pushes Amir away.] UH!<br /><br />Jake: All right, you know what? I wanna know why you did this; walk me through your logic. Take your time. I will not interrupt you.<br /><br />Amir: It's actually kinda silly. (laughs) I woke up late!<br /><br />Jake: You're an asshole.<br /><br />Amir: Whoa! You said you wouldn't interrupt me!<br /><br />Jake: You know what I think happened? I think you got into the idea of owning fur after some weird conversation you had with your cousin Leron or some strange show you saw on TV. You became fur-obsessed, going on a morbid spending spree. And when you ran out of acceptable animals to wear on your body, your blood-thirsty raid took you to the deep, dark corners of the animal wear/ware kingdom, like that pocket iguana or your rat wallet. Either way, you reek of mink and rat blood! So go home! (pause)<br /><br />Amir: Can I talk?<br /><br />Jake: No.<br /><br />Amir: Are you done?<br /><br />Jake: No, you can go home.<br /><br />Amir: Can I speak now!<br /><br />Jake: You know, why don't you at least admit that you're hot in that jacket right now?<br /><br />Amir: I'm boiling. Maybe I can join you in your ivory tower for just a couple minutes, and that'll help me cool off. Or I can hop upon your high horse, and we can go for a ride! You know what? I got this idea from having a conversation with my cousin Leron, not from a \"television show,\" as you astutely observed.<br /><br />Jake: You know, I also said that. That was my first guess.<br /><br />Amir: Secondly, yeah! I became fur-obsessed! You know, it's my nature to take things too far; some people love me for that.<br /><br />Jake: Nobody loves you.. for anything.<br /><br />Amir: (pretend stabs heart) OH!<br /><br />Jake: No, that did hurt you; I know it.<br /><br />Amir: A little bit, yes, because I didn't think you'd get that personal.<br /><br />Jake: Just move on.<br /><br />Amir: I became blood-hungry! Sure, who wouldn't? And who wouldn't feel a little bit guilty after strangling a scared iguana? Obviously, animals can't... (laughs) talk! But this little guy was begging me with his eyes for mercy. I don't know if you've ever seen an iguana cry before, but I know for a fact that I have.<br /><br />Jake: Can you stop talking about strangling the iguana?<br /><br />Amir: And as for your last point, I think I will go home as this has turned into a public shaming of me! Adieu!<br /><br />Jake: Are you wearing dead doves on your feet?<br /><br />Amir: THEY'RE RAVENS.<br /><br />Jake: They're white.<br /><br />Amir: THEY'RE... DOVES.<br /><br />THE END",

To thank me for the gift that I got you when you open your drawer and find it.<br /><br />JAKE: I'll look after work, alright?<br /><br />AMIR: You'll look before work! You'll look before work or I'll take it back!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't get mad at me, okay? Work's already started, one, and two: fine, dude, take it back.<br /><br />AMIR: That was an idle threat you ingrate! Open the fricken drawer! Open the fricken box!--<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus! Jesus! Fine! Fine.<br /><br />(Jake takes out colorfully wrapped present and Amir smiles at him.)<br /><br />JAKE: You know, and just so you know, the thought of you brainstorming a gift, going out shopping for a gift, buying something and then wrapping it up with this little bow and sneaking it into work and hiding it in my desk...--<br /><br />AMIR: (laughing) Right, it's great!<br /><br />JAKE: No, it's not great!<br /><br />(Amir stops smiling.)<br /><br />JAKE: It really freaks me out, and I don't think you should do- (takes a Rolex out of the box) and this is a Rolex! It's a Rolex, buddy!<br /><br />AMIR: You know how you're always like, uhh, \"What time is it?\" (chuckles)<br /><br />JAKE: I've never said that to you before.. in my life.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, it's time for me to get you a new watch.<br /><br />(Jake studies the watch.)<br /><br />(Amir makes a strange face.)<br /><br />AMIR: Fffffuck off for not laughing at that, you DIVA-- you diva little--<br /><br />JAKE: (while Amir is talking) You're an ass. You're an asshole! I don't want this gift from you!<br /><br />AMIR: --I'm sorry, you're a cunt!<br /><br />JAKE: Shut up dude! You just yelled \"cunt\" in the office.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that it was obviously a little too much.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, you know what? (Jake gets up and walks over to Amir. Amir stands up as well.)<br /><br />AMIR: You're right, what are we doing? This isn't us! (Chuckles and then goes in for a hug, but Jake pushes him back.) Oh.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't.. hug me. No, okay? (picking up a folder off Amir's desk) What is this manila folder (looking through the folder) Sketches. Photos. A VENN DIAGRAM. I mean dude, this is psychotic!<br /><br />AMIR: What's psychotic is you trying to embarrass me for caring about you too much.<br /><br />JAKE: You wrote a teleplay... A full-on script about how you wanted this moment to play out!<br /><br />AMIR: And the messed-up thing? I was pretty fricken close.<br /><br />JAKE: You weren't at all! \"Upon seeing the watch he's dreamt of but never described aloud, Jake cries tears of soy.\"? Is that a typo?<br /><br />AMIR: (slightly exasperated at how Jake could think that) No. I don't mistype.<br /><br />JAKE: You wrote my name as \"J J K A E\" every single time.<br /><br />AMIR: Poetic license.<br /><br />JAKE: \"He realizes only his soulmate could've seen into his mind's eye and found his dream watch, the same one he never knew he even wanted.\" (Amir puts his fingers to his temples and then points at Jake, smiling.) \"Jake is struck by the awe of this moment.\" You know.. that's too much scene direction.<br /><br />AMIR: It's supposed to come through in the performance.<br /><br />JAKE: Bad writing.<br /><br />AMIR: Bad writing huh? Nah. (grabs his collar and jerks his hands forward, letting go.)<br /><br />JAKE: Bad me, I know.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Bad you!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, I said that.<br /><br />AMIR: Try it on! Do me the courtesy!<br /><br />JAKE: (exasperated) I actually can't try it on, 'cause I don't know how many links you got removed from this thing, but it might as well be a ring.<br /><br />AMIR: We all know you have notoriously small wrists.<br /><br />JAKE: Nobody has wrists this small; they'd be dead.<br /><br />AMIR: Then I can return it<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I'm not sure you can, 'cause according to your script, you ripped up the receipt in front of the watch salesman. You said \"What's your return policy? Because if you think Jake will ever return this, it's a fallacy.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah and you know what he did?<br /><br />JAKE: According to your script he \"cried tears of soy.\"<br /><br />AMIR: (simultaneously with Jake) CRIED TEARS OF SOY, yeah, exactly right!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not a real thing. That can't happen.<br /><br />AMIR: Really? Okay, here we go, 'cause look at this! (Wipes away a soy tear from his eye and shows it to Jake.)<br /><br />JAKE: Huh!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my god, HELP US!<br /><br />AMIR: I'm cryin'!<br /><br />JAKE: He's crying soy!<br /><br />AMIR: Tears of soy!<br /><br />JAKE: Tears of soy!<br /><br />AMIR: (crying) Oh, I'm beefing!

I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled. I'm just a little... thrown off, is all.<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] We could push it to four...<br /><br />AMIR: No need! Three-thirty's actually better for me 'cause I have this cardiologist appointment that I'd hate to push...<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Alright. Four's good.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, okay, I'll-- ...yeah, I'll make things work; I'll shuffle it around. I just have this pacemaker thing that I need re-calibrated; it, like-- ah, it kills me.<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Cool!<br /><br />AMIR: Cool. Yeah, cool! Nah, you're right. Absolutely. I just-- I'm really close to death, but... totally. What should I bring? This is my first meeting. [chuckles] A fruit plate? What--<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Yo, shut up, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: Of course! I'm just excited about the meeting. Alright? In fact... permission to lead it?<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] I'm here. Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Alright, yeah! And I will be there too! I will be there leading the meeting! Then it is agreed-ing.<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Yo, you really have to be quiet.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't tell me how to conduct my own meeting, alright? I'm now the leader! And I'm not bringing a fruit plate to my own meeting only to be told how to act by some-- some underling, some college drop-out!<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Sorry, there's just this idiot yelling in my ear right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Apology accepted! But if you don't want someone yelling in your ear, I suggest you put down the phone!<br /><br />JAKE: [on the phone] Alright! I'll see you there!<br /><br />[Jake hangs up.]<br /><br />AMIR: No you won't.<br /><br />JAKE: ...What?<br /><br />AMIR: What? \"What,\" like I'm not gonna be there? No... \"what\" like you're not gonna be there.<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about right now?<br /><br />AMIR: Don't worry about it, \"bro\"! [scoffs] Go back to watching wrestling, \"bro\"! [scoffs] Go back to eating chicken nuggets out of your brother's asshole, \"bro\"!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you think I said \"bro\" at some point? You're mimicking something you misheard.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't worry about it...<br /><br />JAKE: ...\"bro\"?<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] ...\"bro\"! Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay...<br /><br />[Jake is at the meeting. He is the only one not dressed in a suit.]<br /><br />JAKE: Well-- okay, I guess I didn't get the suit memo. I'm sorry about that. Uh, why don't we just jump right in--<br /><br />[Amir appears at the door holding a fruit plate and wearing a top hat and a sash reading \"LEADER\" in large gold letters.]<br /><br />AMIR: How's the heating in this meeting? If you're wondering why I'm asking, it's because I'm... Jake, what are you doing here?<br /><br />JAKE: Get out.<br /><br />AMIR: Of my own meeting? [laughs, holds up the fruit plate and points to it] Gee whiz, Jake! I'd rather not!<br /><br />JAKE: This isn't your meeting, man. Leave.<br /><br />AMIR: Treason! This is more than a coup d'etat!<br /><br />JAKE: I don't know where you got the impression that you were even allowed in this room, let alone leading our meeting.<br /><br />AMIR: Where I got the impression was from you, ya coward! In fact, you guys are all cowards for listening to this snake-oil salesman. [laughs] ...Get him. I'm sorry, Jake, but-- guys, get him.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I don't think--<br /><br />[The two guys next to Jake pin his hands to the table.]<br /><br />JAKE: --Okay, hey--<br /><br />[Gonny, the guy on Jake's left, addresses Amir.]<br /><br />Gonny: O Captain! My Captain! What shall we do with this traitor?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Off with his head!<br /><br />JAKE: \"Off with my head\", dude? [laughs] G--<br /><br />[Gonny stands up behind Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: Gonny... Gonny, what are you doing-- I-- oh!<br /><br />[Gonny grabs Jake's head and tries to rip it off. Amir looks on, and the other people present laugh and cheer.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ah! Okay! Ah, I'll leave! Ow, I'll leave!<br /><br />AMIR: You'll leave in a body bag, ya Benedict Hey-Arnold! Unless that's not your style, \"bro\"!<br /><br />JAKE: I never said \"bro\"!<br /><br />[Gonny yells with rage as he continues trying to decapitate Jake.]",

Congrats, bud! We're rich!<br /><br />[Amir puts his hand out and pantomimes a handshake.]<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I think I'm gonna work from the conference room today, so--<br /><br />AMIR: Oh wait-- we're actually not rich at all! 'Cause Zark Fuckernerd has us bent over a table, owning every single photo we've posted to Instagram! I'm sorry, pal!<br /><br />JAKE: ...Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Okay\"? No way! Instagram's new privacy policy claims that it can and will sell all of your photos to the highest bidder!<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about?<br /><br />AMIR: What am I talking about? I'm talking about you don't own your shit! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is, okay? That's why I posted this paragraph to my Facebook profile which should stop the bleeding for now while my lawyers look over the fine print. Actually, give me your email. I will forward you this paragraph and you gotta copy and paste it precisely. Otherwise they'll find the fuckin' loopholes in it, I swear to God they will. Those micey, micey bastards.<br /><br />JAKE: We've worked together for six years. Do you really not know my email?<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, better yet, don't even give it to me, 'cause I fear that my email is being monitored, hacked, or worse: both, by King Zark himself. Yeah, he's all up there, trollin' around looking for paintings and shit, art that I have in my head.<br /><br />JAKE: Art in your head?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! I'm being Thomas-Crown-Affaired by the Facebook dictator himself! Yeah, he's makin' his way into the art museum of my brain while I sleep, crawlin' around, makin' his way out with billion-- nay, million-dollar ideas for paintings and shit?<br /><br />JAKE: That's less money, okay? You really think Mark Zuckerberg wants to steal and then sell this photo of you... planking at a candlelight vigil? ...I mean, I don't even know what the vigil's for, but I think no matter what, it's pretty depraved!<br /><br />AMIR: \"I saw the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by madness. Starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix!\" Do you know who said that?<br /><br />JAKE: Allen Ginsberg.<br /><br />AMIR: Amir Blumenfeld!<br /><br />JAKE: No! No. You ass.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing maniacally, cackling] It's working! Don't you get it? It's absolutely working! He's pitting brother against brother!<br /><br />JAKE: Who is? Who's stealing from you?<br /><br />AMIR: Ginsberg! Zuckerberg! All these frickin' Jew billionaires! Don't you get it? I make these Instagram photos for me! I write these Facebook statuses for me, so that if one day, let's say I want to sell them, that should be my money! That's my prerogative; that should be my money!<br /><br />JAKE: W-- what are you talking about? What do you think you agreed to--<br /><br />AMIR: I'm saying if I want to approach a-- a huge brand, like a Doritos or a Coca-Cola--<br /><br />JAKE: They would never buy anything from you. You think they have any interest in your status? \"Going to the mall? Nah. Going to the mall high. Like this status and I'll smoke you out.\"<br /><br />AMIR: They like quirky, cheeky, irreverent humor.<br /><br />JAKE: That's not quirky, cheeky, or irreverent. It's not even humor.<br /><br />AMIR: Do you watch the British Office?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't ask me about the British Office.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious, do you watch the British Office, with Richard Gervais?<br /><br />JAKE: You're comparing your desperate wannabe-stoner status with one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time?<br /><br />AMIR: All's I know is that last night I had a dream of a painting, and today it's the friggin' logo of the Facebook! Okay? Is that just a coincidence? Are you really that ignorant? Are you really that fuckin' blind?<br /><br />JAKE: That's it, dude! That's it! Do something more important with your day.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. Fuck off, alright? Have a good life! Good luck being classless, assless, deaf, and dumb! You know why? 'Cause Facebook's robbin' ya! Instagram's rapin' ya! And Myspace? [puts his finger in his mouth and makes a popping sound] It's givin' ya the old how-do-you-do! [wiggles his finger in the air]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Holy shit.<br /><br />[Amir keeps wiggling his finger.]<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit, what are you saying?<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Here. [throws a baseball cap with \"FOR SALE\" printed on it at Jake] Here you go! You deserve this. Hey guys! Listen up, good news! Jake's now for sale! Make sure to make your check out to Zark frickin' Dinkenberg!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, yeah! [puts on the hat] Everybody, actually, while you're here-- this is good-- gather 'round, 'cause Amir's gonna delete his Facebook and Instagram!<br /><br />AMIR: ...Hah?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Hah?\" No, right? You found out they've been robbing us blind from the get-go! He's figured 'em out, so he's decided to take the moral high ground and delete both accounts.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, okay. You've made your point. Relax. You'll-- you'll make a martyr of me.<br /><br />JAKE: No, really! I really think you should do that. Delete both the accounts, right now.<br /><br />[Amir stares back silently, then without warning begins crying and covers his face.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Oh my God.<br /><br />[Amir sobs quietly to himself.]<br /><br />JAKE: You're an adult man. You're a grown-up; a fully-grown person. Jesus, buddy!<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] What, buddy? I'm sad.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay! I'm sorry.<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] I just-- I don't want to delete it! It's, like, the best website ever, and-- and Instagram is the tightest app.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, so keep it!<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] Okay. Yeah, you're right. And I'll take 'em down from the inside.<br /><br />[Pat walks up with a Red Bull can.]<br /><br />PAT: Hey Amir, congrats on being the new face of Red Bull!<br /><br />AMIR: Noooooo!<br /><br />PAT: Are you planking at a vigil on here?<br /><br />[The logo on Pat's Red Bull can is a photo of Amir planking in the middle of hundreds of candles.]",

On Amir's desk is a chicken idly looking around.]<br /><br />JAKE: I think I'm gonna work from home today.<br /><br />[Jake turns to leave, but is stopped by Rick Fox, who restrains Jake with a hand to the face.]<br /><br />RICK: Yeah, you're not going anywhere.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Rick Fox?<br /><br />RICK: I head you're the, uh, chicken whisperer.<br /><br />JAKE: From who?<br /><br />RICK: [points to Josh, who is working in the background] Everyone.<br /><br />JAKE: That's... just-- that's Josh.<br /><br />RICK: Yeah, I need your help.<br /><br />JAKE: What.<br /><br />RICK: My chicken's more than sick.

Did you come to steal more money from Amir?<br /><br />RICK: Actually, dick, I'm here to tell Amir that I'm out of the bookie business.<br /><br />[Amir gasps.]<br /><br />RICK: My beautiful wife, [to Jake] who is not a chicken...<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't say she was. You shouldn't have to clarify that.<br /><br />RICK: She convinced me I need a more honest trade.<br /><br />AMIR: Mm. Yeah, that makes sense.<br /><br />RICK: So I'm just here to collect Amir's eight-thousand-dollar quitting fee.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't sound very honest.<br /><br />AMIR: No, it is.

I'm getting really pissed off about it.<br /><br />RICK: You are the only one talking about eggs.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Fine, what have you spent your entire life obsessing over?<br /><br />RICK: Omelettes!<br /><br />JAKE: ...Omelettes are eggs! Omelettes are eg--<br /><br />[Rick picks Jake up by the collar.]<br /><br />RICK: What did you say?<br /><br />JAKE: Nothing! Nothing, okay? I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br /><br />RICK: Say it again. Say it one more time.<br /><br />AMIR: Say it to his face!<br /><br />JAKE: I don't want to!

I'm glad that I'm not the only person here who thinks this guy is completely--<br /><br />[Elisa picks up Jake by the collar.]<br /><br />ELISA: What did you say about eggs, motherfucker?<br /><br />JAKE: God. She's crazier.<br /><br />ELISA: Say it.

[takes a bite]<br /><br />JAKE: What are you talking about, \"being named after\" chicken?<br /><br />ELISA: Like an Arnold Palmer isn't made of Arnold Palmer! He's a golfer, not a drink. [to Rick] I learned that the hard way, remember?<br /><br />JAKE: No, chicken nuggets are made of chicken. They kill a chicken, grind up the meat and then shape it into nuggets.<br /><br />[Rick is taken aback. Elisa chuckles, but quickly stops.]<br /><br />ELISA: Come on, baby. Go. Go, go--<br /><br />[Rick runs to a garbage can and vomits.]<br /><br />RICK: I'm a cannibal!<br /><br />[Rick vomits again, then kneels in front of the chicken.]<br /><br />RICK: [to the chicken] Baby...

Five AM? 4:05 AM?<br /><br />JAKE: 7:45 PM, the All-Nighter starts in another fifteen minutes, and it goes for twelve hours.<br /><br />AMIR: Stop hounding my shit, please, okay?

The truth comes tumbling out. Jake's a frickin' anti-Semite. And that just ain't right.<br /><br />ANDREW-JAKE: ...What?<br /><br />[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are themselves; Amir seems to be talking in his sleep.]<br /><br />AMIR: I said \"You, Jacob Hurwitz... you're an anti-Semite.\"<br /><br />[Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew and Evan have gathered around Jake's chair.]<br /><br />NICK: What did he just say?<br /><br />JAKE: He's half-asleep, dude.

What, because he's a Jew?<br /><br />[Abbi shoves Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say that!

I got away with it! That video lies to you; it's propaganda!<br /><br />JAKE: No, it's actually not.

I mean... listen to this.<br /><br />[Jake unplugs his headphones and hits the volume-up key. Amir's voice fades in. As they listen, Amir, whose sunglasses disappeared again at some point, nods in acknowledgement of the audio. Jake shakes his head to say \"no\".

Right? The Germans call it \"schadenfreude\". [chuckles] Americans do too! It's funny: we were enemies for so long, but we still use some of their phrases. C'est la vie!

Jake is listening to something on his computer.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey. Hey, you're in a YouTube video. And-- ...you're an asshole. Oh my God, you're an asshole.<br /><br />[Amir looks up at Jake. He has a bruised eye and a large, somewhat bloodstained head bandage.]<br /><br />AMIR: Is it viral?<br /><br />JAKE: I think it might go viral; it's you trying and failing to jack an iPhone on the subway.<br /><br />AMIR: Bull... shite! I got away with it! That video lies to you; it's propaganda!<br /><br />JAKE: No, it's actually not. I can see very clearly: this girl is texting on her iPhone and you just rip it out of her hands; you try to time it just right so you can get out there before the doors close--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: --but no. You thought it was a good idea to turn around and say [Amir begins pointing and mouthing Jake's quote, as if re-living the moment] \"time for you to disconnect permanently\", and then wink at her.<br /><br />[Amir nods in acknowledgement.]<br /><br />JAKE: How did you think you had time for that?<br /><br />[Amir is suddenly wearing a pair of sunglasses over his regular glasses.]<br /><br />AMIR: Frankly, my dear... [looks over the sunglasses] I don't give a damn.<br /><br />JAKE: You should give a damn, because here you are running around the train like an animal, like a scared rat, trying to burrow your way out of the door, large crowds just forming around you, and then you... you lay on the ground; you start kicking and screaming. I mean... listen to this.<br /><br />[Jake unplugs his headphones and hits the volume-up key. Amir's voice fades in. As they listen, Amir, whose sunglasses disappeared again at some point, nods in acknowledgement of the audio. Jake shakes his head to say \"no\". Amir copies Jake mockingly.]<br /><br />AMIR: [in-video] Fire! There's a fire in here! Somebody please press the emergency brake! I swear to God, there's a frickin' fire in here!<br /><br />AMIR: And it worked! ...Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, except finally when someone does press the emergency brake, it just gives the gang that much more time to beat the shit out of you! ...That's not smart! ...That wasn't good thinking!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, but-- [scoffs] have you ever, like, gone to the gym and forgot your shoes?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Like, leaving my house, without my shoes--<br /><br />AMIR: Forget-- I knew you wouldn't get it--<br /><br />JAKE: Of course!<br /><br />AMIR: I knew you would just hang me out to dry, because you love seeing me fail! Right? The Germans call it \"schadenfreude\". [chuckles] Americans do too! It's funny: we were enemies for so long, but we still use some of their phrases. C'est la vie!

Throughout the episode he sounds out-of-breath to the point that his voice is raw or cracking.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay! Ever heard of a get rich quick scheme? Well these are wet bitch thick creams; ninety-nine ways guaranteed to get us paid ASAP! [laughs maniacally]<br /><br />JAKE: So they are get rich quick schemes.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: You said they were \"wet bitch thick creams\"--<br /><br />AMIR: \"--ick creams\", yeah! [laughs] Okay, number one--<br /><br />JAKE: What is wrong with you right now? Don't yell; catch your breath.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Asshole.<br /><br />AMIR: What if we sell gift certificates that you have to accept at any store?<br /><br />JAKE: That's just money.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, exactly! We sell cash, for pennies on the dollar! [rubs his fingers together]<br /><br />JAKE: That means you lose money.<br /><br />AMIR: But ya gain pennies! [rubs his fingers together again]<br /><br />JAKE: You have to chill out, okay?<br /><br />AMIR: You know how people love juices and smoothies and shit?<br /><br />JAKE: I guess.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, so we get a paperclip, put it in a smoothie, drink it, die, and sue the Jew that sold it to us!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not where I thought you were going with that--<br /><br />AMIR: Well keep up, Jakey! 'Cause my mind's racing at m--<br /><br />[Amir stops, chokes, and coughs up a lot of blood into his hand. Then he begins laughing.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God!

Mr. People's my dad's name.\" [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't call you anything.<br /><br />AMIR: Why don't me and you, we open up a frickin' pottery store, huh? How's that sound? Some choice pieces at first, but then we'd build up our inventory, start franchising some stores?<br /><br />JAKE: How is that a get rich quick scheme? Sounds like that would take years.<br /><br />[Amir puts his hand on Jake's shoulder.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's the first smart thing you've said today.<br /><br />[Amir has his arm around Jake so tightly that he's pressing his cheek against Jake's shoulder.]<br /><br />JAKE: Don't touch me, dude. I'm dead serious right now.<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you this out-of-breath, by the way? I mean, like... you look like you just ran a ten-K.<br /><br />AMIR: I'd like to run a 401(k)! Your frickin' retirement fund for a price, but first, [pats Jake on the stomach] how'd you like to open up a pottery store with me?<br /><br />AMIR: Ever heard of a nutritionist? Well I'm an oldtritionist! Pay me to eat a weed!<br /><br />JAKE: That cannot be on your--<br /><br />[Jake glances at Amir's notepad.]<br /><br />JAKE: --list. There it is. \"Pay me to eat a weed.\"<br /><br />[Amir is coughing large amounts of blood into a tissue.]<br /><br />JAKE: You okay, man?<br /><br />[Amir nods.]<br /><br />JAKE: You want me to call a doctor?<br /><br />AMIR: Call a doc-- Call a lawyer! I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!<br /><br />JAKE: That's actually really smart--<br /><br />AMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis! [laughs] I knew you'd shit on it! [laughs] Isn't your face redder than a beet! ...Speaking of beets, [puts his arm around Jake] do you got a garden? I'd love to eat a weed.<br /><br />[Amir is slumped down on the couch, holding the bloodstained tissue.]<br /><br />JAKE: Want to take a break?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, great idea. Let's take a-- let's take a hard five, go outside, get some fresh air, come back in here with a renewed sense of purpose to tackle the second half of the list--<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, I'm gonna take you to the hospital--<br /><br />AMIR: Please do, [chuckles] 'cause at this point in time, I believe that I am, uh...

Jake quietly spits out the food he was chewing onto the plate in disgust. Amir scoffs.]<br /><br />AMIR: [still quietly] Oh my God...<br /><br />[Jake stares daggers at Amir. Streeter puts down the sandwich he had been eating for lunch. He folds his glasses up and buries his head in his hands.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Yeah? You can't--<br /><br />[Streeter shakes his head. Amir scoffs again.]<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] ...What?<br /><br />[Amir makes a gun shape with his hand, points it at his head, and pantomimes shooting himself. Jake nods and mouths \"do it\". Amir looks dejected, and halfheartedly attempts to chuckle. Streeter is still sitting in silence, and Jake pats Streeter's shoulder to console him. Amir attempts to do the same, but Streeter swats his hand away and then gets up and leaves.

Can't booze!\"<br /><br />JAKE: You absolute monster, you're talking about poisoning your family.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number six: I can fix this. '911? My dad's real sick!

Yeah!'\"<br /><br />JAKE: You depraved lunatic! Okay, you're talking about calling an ambulance in front of your dying family, and then not giving the EMT team the directions to your house? You'll-- you'll go to jail for that! I think you'd go to jail for even writing that!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh no! Jail! Well, I have a plan that won't fail. \"Number five: 'Keep me alive! I don't want your death penalty, Your Honor! It was a simple mistake! Does your yard need to be raked?'\"<br /><br />JAKE: Great, so your \"plan that won't fail\" is to publicly bribe a judge, [Amir grins smugly as Jake speaks] in a court of law, with a task that could easily do himself?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number four: 'This yard work's a bore! I don't wanna do this chore!'\"<br /><br />JAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three:\"<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit...<br /><br />AMIR: \"...fireworks for me! Head down to the local docks and watch the red, white, and blue o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Our ancestors fought, bled, and even died for this country, and the least we can do is take a moment to celebrate their effort, to cherish what we have. Even if life isn't perfect-- you know, 'cause let's face it, whose is?-- just sit down and reflect. You know, you can make anything you want for yourself, and that's what America is; that's what makes it the greatest country in the world!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. ...Okay!<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number two: take a poo.

Yeah, Shia the frickin' Beef, in the flesh! You're looking at a quadruple-threat, motherfucker! [begins counting down on his fingers for emphasis] Film star! Movie star! TV star! And guess what? [makes a popping sound with his mouth] He's got an Instagram!<br /><br />JAKE: Does he really?<br /><br />AMIR: Not yet, but you're looking at a social media team, [gestures to Mike and himself] and you'd better believe that's top-notch number-one priority.<br /><br />JAKE: You know you have an actual job here, right?<br /><br />AMIR: Not for long!<br /><br />JAKE: You're probably right-- also, how does having an Instagram make him a quadruple-threat?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't even know why I'm talking to you right now! You're sitting in the king's throne! Up, or off with your head!<br /><br />JAKE: This is my desk.<br /><br />MIKE: [pointing behind himself] I can sit over there...<br /><br />AMIR: No! Nonsense, sir! And I'm really sorry you have to see me like this, but please, Jake! Immediately! Get the fuck up! This is Shia the fuckin' Beef!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I think you actually like when he sees you like this. I think you get off on it, 'cause you act this way every single time Mike Fink-- by the way, not Shia LaBeouf-- comes to the office.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Mike Fink\", right? \"John Doe\"? Okay? We don't have to use alii. We're friends here, and Shia, by the way, you're not foolin' anyone, okay? I can smell Megan Fox's naked box on your bated breath, and guess what? [imitates cunnilingus with his fingers] It tastes good!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: Don't tell me what to do; only one person can tell me what to do, and he's standing right here. [points to Mike]<br /><br />MIKE: Yeah, you really shouldn't do that.<br /><br />AMIR: Then I won't.<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you think he's Shia LaBeouf? Why do you think that?<br /><br />AMIR: Chia the frickin' Bean! Get it right or pay the price.<br /><br />JAKE: You're mispronouncing it.<br /><br />[Will suddenly appears and runs up to Mike.]<br /><br />WILL: Excuse me? Mister LaBeouf? I know it's not my place, but could I trouble you for an autograph?<br /><br />MIKE: ...Sure...<br /><br />[Mike takes Will's marker, and writes \"MIKE\" on his paper. Will grabs the paper excitedly and runs away.]<br /><br />AMIR: Now do you believe me?<br /><br />JAKE: What, 'cause Will asked for an autograph?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: That guy eats his own shit.<br /><br />AMIR: Low blow!<br /><br />JAKE: How so?<br /><br />AMIR: Hell no! Shia, please! Enlighten the man!<br /><br />MIKE: My name is Mike, and I'm not a celebrity.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Wow! [pause] Ever humble, even though this motherfucker starred in Holes, then went on to fill up Megan Fox's holes! I'm serious, dude! You gotta tell me about that shit! I want the deets! I have such a crush on her.<br /><br />JAKE: This is so inappropriate for work!<br /><br />AMIR: Wow, Jake's never been to Hollywood, Nollywood, nor Bollywood. And it's clear to me that Megan Fox jumped on your jolly wood, and rode that dolly good!<br /><br />JAKE: Will you please let Mike work?<br /><br />AMIR: I will! And I'll help him work; in fact, I want to be your Johnny Drama and your Turtle. If there's anything you need, I'm your man. I might be a vegetarian, but tonight... I'm eating Beef!<br /><br />JAKE: You're not a vegetarian.<br /><br />AMIR: That's actually a good point: we should release a sex tape.<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say that.<br /><br />AMIR: No no no, something tasteful at first-- you know, a little kissy-kissy, a little anal-- and then, when people aren't ready for it, boom! We hit 'em with the big one! We're viral!<br /><br />JAKE: What's tasteful about kissy-kissy and then going to anal?<br /><br />AMIR: Kissy-kissy! [makes kissing noises] Kissy-kissy!<br /><br />JAKE: Anal.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Oh.<br /><br />JAKE: If anal is tasteful to you, what's \"the big one\"?<br /><br />[Will walks up behind them with brown smears around his mouth.]<br /><br />WILL: Uh, sorry, could I get a selfie?<br /><br />[Will holds out his phone to take a picture of himself with Mike.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, Will, what were you eating?<br /><br />WILL: Uh... [takes the picture] my own shit, actually.<br /><br />END",

My nose is bleeding.<br /><br />JAKE: It's always bleeding.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, but this time it's, like, for real!<br /><br />JAKE: [rapping in a low nasal voice] Ass so frat, we sat at the frat, we back to the frat, we sat on that ass, we back to the frat!<br /><br />AMIR: What are you doing?<br /><br />JAKE: I got a bid! ...That's what I'm doing!<br /><br />AMIR: What's a bid?<br /><br />[Jake holds up a paper reading \"Congratulations on Your Bid to Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon, Jake Hurwitz\", decorated with an emblem for YYY as well as a pattern of skulls and crossbones.]<br /><br />JAKE: A bid is a ticket! A ticket in! I'm a goddamn Greek god now. Okay? I'm pledging a frat.<br /><br />AMIR: Why are you pledging a frat?<br /><br />JAKE: First of all, can you not do me the disservice? Don't do me the dishonor, the disrespect of calling it a \"frat\"? Okay? It's a fraternity. Would you call your country a cunt?<br /><br />AMIR: My country's a cunt.<br /><br />JAKE: Traitor!<br /><br />AMIR: You called it a frat first!<br /><br />JAKE: Did I? Did I for real though? [suddenly nervous] ...Don't tell my Bigs. Do not-- dude, I'll suck your dick.<br /><br />AMIR: Stop it.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I will.<br /><br />AMIR: I know. Stop it!<br /><br />JAKE: Secondly, being in a fraternity is the highest form of brotherhood. It gets you made, paid, and-- oh yeah!-- it gets you laid.<br /><br />AMIR: How does it get you paid?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Sorry?<br /><br />AMIR: How does it get you paid?<br /><br />JAKE: It gets you laid, I said.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you said paid, and made--<br /><br />JAKE: Made.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Paid.<br /><br />JAKE: P-- You know what? It gets you paid in pussy. Yeah. That's what it does. Liquid pussy. That's currency in my frat. Okay? My fraternity. You got that? Have you ever hooked up with a sorority girl?<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: Well you know what? Pretty soon, that's something you and I won't have in common.<br /><br />AMIR: Isn't there, like, hazing and stuff?<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit, you really don't get it, do you? Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon doesn't believe in hazing, okay? They believe in the bond, forged by brothers, committing acts of courage for one another.<br /><br />AMIR: So what did you have to do?<br /><br />JAKE: Eat socks, chug a bottle of absinthe 'till I puked, get whipped on my ass, wear a vibrating dildo around my neck for an entire day, call my mom, tell her my brother was dead, call my brother, tell him I was gay, and me and a bunch of other pledges had to hold each other's dicks in a basement while we walked around like elephants. It's called the elephant-walk and, uh, this elephant wishes he could forget. [chuckles] I also ate six banana peels--<br /><br />AMIR: Jesus! Why?<br /><br />JAKE: Because I'm not allowed to question why! Because our bond is tighter than the glue they used to seal my asshole shut before our Triple Chili Challenge. Okay? Because Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon is a global... brand!<br /><br />[Jake holds up his arm. \"YYY\" has been branded onto his bicep.]<br /><br />AMIR: Holy shit!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah!<br /><br />AMIR: Did that hurt?<br /><br />JAKE: Still hurts! Hasn't stopped hurting! It's a third-degree burn, brother! But, um, I can think of something hotter! It's a sorority girl's ta-tas! And-- they're on my ya-ya!<br /><br />AMIR: Why, why, why!<br /><br />JAKE: [slaps the brand] Why not?<br /><br />AMIR: No, I was just reading it. Y-Y-Y.<br /><br />[A beeper on Jake's desk vibrates.]<br /><br />JAKE: Shit! Dude, that's Dick-Tooth. Give me your phone, quick!<br /><br />AMIR: Why don't you just call him on your phone?<br /><br />JAKE: 'Cause Dick-T threw it in a river!<br /><br />AMIR: You mean Dick-Tooth.<br /><br />JAKE: No! It's two different people, ass! Give me your phone, or I can kiss my bid goodbye!<br /><br />[A member of the fraternity, presumably Dick-Tooth, shows up.]<br /><br />DICK-TOOTH: Holy shit! God damn, Hur-bitch! I thought you was dead! I beeped you, and I got nothing back!<br /><br />JAKE: [standing at attention] It is I: Hur-bitch. I am your humble servant; you are my proud master. Your word is my command. You letters are my brand. [displays YYY brand]<br /><br />END",

[chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: I feel bad for you.<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are at their desks. Amir is chugging a water bottle. He wiggles his eyebrows at Jake, who's watching him disinterestedly. Amir swishes the water around in his mouth.]<br /><br />JAKE: Swallow it.<br /><br />[Cut back to Amir, who now has water droplets on his shirt.]<br /><br />AMIR: Want to know a cute little life-hack? [wipes his mouth] If you're interested.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm actually not interested. And that was very foul.<br /><br />AMIR: It'll save you time and money, let alone effort, and... did I mention c-c-c-c-c-c-cash?<br /><br />JAKE: You did when you said \"money\".<br /><br />AMIR: Every time I fly, when I land, I'll pen a little complaint to the airline that flew me. You know, I'll come up with something like, uh, \"oh, they denied me a drink\", \"oh, the food wasn't vegetarian\"-- whatever miscellaneous hogwash pot-pourri comes to my crazy brain-- and like clockwork, within a business day, they're reimbursing me with a fifty-dollar voucher, a hundred-dollar voucher. I can sell that on the secondary market.<br /><br />JAKE: You absolute ass.<br /><br />AMIR: And proud of it!<br /><br />JAKE: You jerk.<br /><br />AMIR: Stop it! [laughing weakly] Okay? A-- a \"thank you\" would have sufficed, for saving you time, money, effort, and let alone c-c-c-c-cash!<br /><br />JAKE: How does it save me time or effort? It costs both of those things, and you know, for most people this involves overcoming some kind of moral obstacle.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I'm not most peoples!<br /><br />JAKE: You say that like it's a good thing; it's a very bad thing. Alright? You're endangering people's jobs.<br /><br />AMIR: Enda-- no, more than endangering! I've actually taken a pilot's wings before. I mean he wasn't fired, as it were, but he was definitely forced into an early retirement! I'm actually locked into litigation right now, so I can't speak with too much more detail about what's going on. [chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: What's going on?<br /><br />AMIR: We're nine months deep and I do not have the capital to sustain this frickin' Law & Order: SV-Fuck-U! I have been grilled by several expert witnesses and a lot of professional cross-examiners, and I'm just sitting under oath, lying through my teeth at this point! [laughing] I actually broke twice! Yeah, I couldn't even keep a straight face. My own lawyer left the courtroom mid-testimony.<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus!<br /><br />AMIR: It is a shit-show! I'm so heavy in debt, but nobody wants to take this on pro-bueno! Seriously, I'm two million in the hole, and at this point I have to win the frickin' case just to break even! How is that normal? How is that fair?<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? It's fair because it's all your fault! You did this to yourself; you're-- ...dude, you're robbing airlines!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, they rob us.<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't. Please.<br /><br />AMIR: No, have you-- have you seen these fares? They're gouging us!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't turn this into some kind of noble cause, okay? You're incapable of having an idea that big.<br /><br />AMIR: Have you seen Erin Brokovich?<br /><br />JAKE: You're a small-time crook.<br /><br />AMIR: Have you seen Erin Brokovich?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, I've seen Erin Brokovich, and you know what? She brought a small town to its feet and a corporation to its knees. You, sir, are no Erin Brokovich.<br /><br />AMIR: [finishing his thought undeterred] Well I'm Erin Choke-a-bitch!<br /><br />[Jake stares at Amir. Amir holds his final pose for a very long time for emphasis.]<br /><br />JAKE: Stand up.<br /><br />AMIR: [continuing to hold still] What?<br /><br />JAKE: Stand up. I think I need to fight you.<br /><br />AMIR: Why?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah! Uh--<br /><br />[Jake stands up, clearly not accustomed to fighting but driven by rage nonetheless. Amir stands as well.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...put up your dukes, I guess!<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know if I want to. This is ridiculous!<br /><br />JAKE: I know it's ridiculous, but I think it's finally come to blows, man.<br /><br />AMIR: I can't hurt you! I can't punch you!<br /><br />[Jake punches Amir in the stomach. Amir reflexively punches back, and connects with Jake's face.]<br /><br />JAKE: Aaah! Ass!<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry!<br /><br />[Jake winds up and hits Amir in the jaw. Amir swings his foot around to connect with Jake's leg. Amir also punches Jake, but still seems shocked at his own actions. Jake punches Amir in the face. Jake punches Amir in the face again. Jake punches Amir in the face a third time. Jake winds up a final time and hits Amir in the throat. Amir falls to the floor and struggles to breathe.]<br /><br />AMIR: [gasping] You a-- [gasp] You assh-- [gasp] oh--<br /><br />[Amir's phone rings. He answers it.]<br /><br />AMIR: [gasping] Hello? ...What? ...No, no-- Esquire, sir, with all due respect, that pilot touched me!

Boo. You suck.<br /><br />AMIR: Jake?

Let's just give him our respect--<br /><br />AMIR: My talent is slam poetry, and my passion is sticking it to South America.<br /><br />JAKE: Nope. They're right. Boo. Leave.<br /><br />[Amir holds up his construction-paper cards.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"Uruguay: you are a gay.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Awful. Mean-spirited, small-minded, homophobic, hateful, slanderous, thoughtless, careless--<br /><br />AMIR: \"P--\" okay-- \"Peru: P.U.\" [waves his hand in front of his nose] And, uh, \"Brazil: you can--\" [flips cards] \"--go to hil.\" ...\"go to hell.\" Okay, feel free to not hold your applause to the end.<br /><br />JAKE: They're not doing that.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Nicaragua: I need more agua.\" ...So.<br /><br />JAKE: You know that's Central America, not South.<br /><br />AMIR: It's south of America, and I urge you to stay silent until I'm done.<br /><br />JAKE: You just urged everyone else to applaud.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Jamaica, mon: how 'bout you make a mon? Or are you too high?\"<br /><br />COWORKER 4: Get off the stage, nerd.<br /><br />AMIR: How is this fair? Okay?

You guys are all sheep! [pointing at coworkers] Moo, moo...<br /><br />[Streeter comes up to escort Amir away.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...and especially moo.<br /><br />STREETER: Ok-- Alright.

Don't make me regret traveling with you.<br /><br />JAKE: I regret it. And you know, by the way, we're not actually traveling together. I went on a work trip, and when I got to the airport I went to baggage claim and you came out inside my duffel bag. Coiled up in there with two dislocated shoulders, nearly frozen to death. You whispered, \"Surprise. Help me.

You put a battery in your mouth, you washed it down with an entire bottle of vodka from the minibar, and then said, \"I'll take that free ride to the ER now!\"<br /><br />[Amir flips the bird with both hands.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Hey, room service? Yes, can I get two cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad, and can you take that entire order and shove it up your butt? That's right: go fuck yourself! You've just been Punk'd by Ashton Coutchard! Ha, I wouldn't eat your pig slop if you forced me to butt-chug it!<br /><br />JAKE: You know they can tell what room you're calling from, right?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, bullshit. They did say 228, but I guarantee that's a lucky guess. [on the phone] Yup. Jake Hurwitz speaking.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, when the doctors X-rayed you, they found more than one battery. They found five or six AA's, a nine-volt, and an entire roll of copper wire.<br /><br />AMIR: It's electric!<br /><br />JAKE: That's the terrible joke you made on the operating table to deafening silence, as the nurses sawed into you.<br /><br />AMIR: Boogie-woogie-woogie. [laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: You should be dead.<br /><br />AMIR: Enough! Absolutely no more!<br /><br />AMIR: [flipping channels] Garbage, fake news, reality trash, propaganda, propaganda, the weather channel... Skinemax? [stops flipping and moves his hand to his pants again]<br /><br />JAKE: No! [pulls Amir's hand away]<br /><br />AMIR: You really are becoming a thorn in my side.<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Room service? Hi. Yup, room 228-- no no no no no, don't hang up, that was-- my boy got a hold of the phone earlier, and you know how kids can be. Anyway, we would actually like to order lunch this time. Do you guys have, like, a small seaweed salad? Maybe like a quinoa starter of sorts that you could just roll up into, like, a... like a torpedo and shove up your ass? Like, just shove it up your goddamn ass? [laughs] That's right! My name is Jacob Penn Cooper Valerie Blumenwitz and you were just the victim of a Jerky-Boys-style stunt, AKA a flash mob!<br /><br />[Amir has his butt up in the air. He farts noisily.]<br /><br />AMIR: Did you Instavideo that?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass!<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Hello, room service? No no no, I'm sorry, please, no no, don't hang up, don't hang up. That was my brother. He's going through these-- I actually am calling to apologize. He's going through this, like, pha-- it's not even worth getting into. We actually-- I know this is hard to believe, but we really do want some food. I feel like the boy who cried wolf, but if you can just find it in your heart to-- to believe me one last time, I really w-- I'll make it worth your while. I'll pay you 200 percent. [pause] Gosh, thank you-- thank you so much. I so-- I so, so much appreciate it. [Jake buries his face in a pillow] I don't have a menu on me, but if you have, like a-- any spaghetti dish, like a pasta, like a penne vodka, something tomato-and-cheesy, that you can shove up your ass! That you can shove up your goddamn ass! [laughs] Hello? Hel-- oh my God, you gotta be kidding me! That's like the third time they hung up on me!<br /><br />[There's a loud knock.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh my God, dude, dude, dude, you gotta get that.<br /><br />AMIR: [off screen, crying] Please, please, please! I'm so sorry for prank-calling the hotel! You really- I don't know what got over me, but you can't kick me out! You really cannot kick me out! I deserve to stay here! You don't understand, this is like a vacation for us; this is like a once-in-a-lifetime frickin' thing--<br /><br />JAKE: Just apologize!<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] I'm not going to apologize; it was a joke!<br /><br />AMIR: [still crying] Got 'em.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Got 'em\"? Really?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: You just cried in front of a hotel clerk for thirty minutes 'til he got bored and left.<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone, still crying] Hello, room service? Yeah, can I have, like, a soup, and can you shove it up your, your goddamn-- yeah, your goddamn ass. Thank you. [to Jake] They would. They said they were going to.<br /><br />END",

Alright. Thank you very much Liz, we're gonna definitely be in touch.<br /><br />LIZ: Okay.<br /><br />GIRL ON COUCH: We're hoping to let everybody know by Friday.<br /><br />LIZ: Thank you.<br /><br />AMIR: Though if you ask me? We already found our leading lady.<br /><br />JAKE: Well yeah thanks again, and could you just let the next person know that we're ready?<br /><br />LIZ: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: We gotta go through the whole dog and pony show of at least seeing everybody, but I assure you it is more than a done deal I think we can all agree. Promise us you'll keep monday open?<br /><br />LIZ: Uh, I have a doctor's appointment.<br /><br />AMIR: Cancel it. Sweetheart. Please. Okay? You're as healthy as a clam. We will call you.<br /><br />LIZ: Okay.<br /><br />AMIR: Never. Holy shit, that was awful right?<br /><br />JAKE: She's still close enough to hear you.<br /><br />AMIR: NEXT!<br /><br />GIRL 2: Oh wow, so I guess that's why they call it the blues.<br /><br />AMIR: How does it feel like? I'm serious, how does it feel like?<br /><br />JAKE: Bad english bud.<br /><br />GIRL 2: Excuse me?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious. I musta been to like, what, a million of these?<br /><br />JAKE: You never come to these.<br /><br />AMIR: And I've only ever seen one person ever have it, as much as you currently do. Okay? And uh, Elisabeth Shue turned out alright.<br /><br />GIRL ON COUCH: What?<br /><br />AMIR: I want you to walk out. Walk out right now with your head held high because you just won a goddamn beauty pageant and a talent show all in one. (Singing) There she goes, Miss Americ-NO. That was... What was that? NEXT!<br /><br />PATRICIA: Oh wow, so that's why they call it the blues.<br /><br />JAKE: Great. Thanks. Bye.<br /><br />AMIR (Speaking too loud): Not another goddamn step you beautiful bombshell bitch.<br /><br />JAKE: Wow.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, you Jessica Rabbit meets Jessica Biel A-list (bleep). Patricia? Do me a favor. Remember this moment. Can you do me that solid? Can you remember this moment? Can you remember this time and place? Can you remember what you see and feel? Okay? Because this is the last second of your life that you are in a goddamn A-list fucking (bleep).<br /><br />GIRL ON COUCH: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. I want you to take the scenic route home. I really do, I want you to waltz downstairs, go to the book library, the food store, whatever the FUCK it is you do, and I want you to soak in (inhales deeply) breathe in that privacy for the last FUCKING time, because after this week, after the people see what the performance that you just gave to us for the first time, and honestly, I feel treasured that I got to see it first, your life, as you know it, is completely changed, and I don't think everybody can handle it but I really think you can. Because honestly? You're a goddamn Elisabeth Shue to me. She is. Like I know I've said it before, but like, now I actually mean it. Thank you.<br /><br />PATRICIA: Did I get the part?<br /><br />JAKE: Maybe, not necessarily. We're gonna call you.<br /><br />AMIR: You more than got the part! You got our hearts. Namaste.

Please, can you not tell every single girl that they got the part? Because we're the ones that have to call them, and tell them that they didn't. Besides, I wrote Elton John Blows Papa Smurf, okay? You shouldn't even be here.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />AMIR (Mumbled): Queen.<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: Nothing.<br /><br />JAKE: What did you just say?<br /><br />AMIR: I called you a queen. And you know what? Sure all these girls might not have all gotten the part, but you know what at least they felt like a star for half a minute. And yeah, they'll come crashing back to reality when you tell them the truth, but isn't it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?<br /><br />(All the girls outside start clapping)<br /><br />JAKE: Nope. Don't clap. He said it in a cool way but he couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />AMIR (Speaking to the girls outside): Good news guys. You all got the lead.

Salut.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry... what?<br /><br />JAKE: You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, haha! Sorry.<br /><br />JAKE: It's not a good thing, so. Right?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah yeah yeah, what were you saying?<br /><br />JAKE: It's a picture of Yosemite Valley at sunrise, you commented \"How is this Earth, and how is this porn.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Good question.<br /><br />JAKE (Still reading from Amir's comment): \"If you wanna blow your nut hair back, check my imgur account\" and then the link is a picture of you photoshopped, poorly by the way...<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, your face on Ron Jeremy's body's fucking a map of Africa. That's Earth Porn to you?<br /><br />AMIR: It's subversive!<br /><br />JAKE: It's definitely not!<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry. I had no idea you were a circlejerking diva, when were you gonna come out of the closet on that one?<br /><br />AMIR (At the same time Jake is speaking): Yeah, how long have we known each other that you weren't gonna, yeah, you weren't gonna come out to me? Come on, I'm your best friend, tell me that you're a diva.<br /><br />JAKE (At the same time Amir is speaking): Really? Really? That's how you wanna play this? That's how you're gonna do this? Everybody who thinks you're an asshole?<br /><br />JAKE: Everyone who thinks you're an asshole for posting mean comments and linking to porn? They're a circlejerking diva, and nothing's wrong with you?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. Exactly right, I'm glad you see things MY WAY! My way or the highway!<br /><br />JAKE: Fred Durst?<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a loser, man.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, really?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know if you saw this, but it was trending quite worldwide on twitter, last week, this loser? Went dickless for Michael Chiklis. So. I don't know.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, I see that post. Picture of you from a webcam with your dick tucked between your legs? The text on top reads \"Saw every Michael Chiklis movie\" text on the bottom reads \"Went dickless for him.\" You posted it in a subreddit called Jake and Amir! You know I don't approve of that.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm a good guy greg.<br /><br />JAKE: You're absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: I am, I am a good guy greg.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a scumbag steve.<br /><br />AMIR (Way too angry): Shut the FUCK up! Shut the FUCK up with that!<br /><br />JAKE (Shouting to the office): Is this okay?<br /><br />AMIR: No, it's not! Take it back!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you also post a lot in explain it to me like I'm five. Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.<br /><br />AMIR: The comments were helpful, and I appreciated them.<br /><br />JAKE: How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote \"OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die.\"<br /><br />AMIR: To which I zung'd him back!<br /><br />JAKE: You wrote \"How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes.\"<br /><br />AMIR: To which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.<br /><br />JAKE: They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.<br /><br />AMIR: And counting!<br /><br />JAKE: You commented on his post \"I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime.\" Did you even set up an AMA for that?<br /><br />AMIR: Didn't need to.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!<br /><br />AMIR: You know what, enough. Okay? I already regret even bringing up the fact that I was gonna delete my reddit account because quite frankly at this point in time, I don't even see me having the huevos to pull it off! I really don't!<br /><br />JAKE: If you need a little encouragement, why don't you look at the front page. Where it says \"If this post gets ten thousand upvotes Amir Blumenfeld will kill himself.\"<br /><br />AMIR: And?<br /><br />JAKE: Got a hundred and fifty.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Thousand. Upvotes.<br /><br />AMIR: A thousand?<br /><br />JAKE: A hundred and fifty thousand. For you to kill yourself.<br /><br />AMIR: No, I know.<br /><br />JAKE: Like they want you dead. Yeah.<br /><br />AMIR starts crying<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. Of course. Yeah? A little tears?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Crying?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Sobbing?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Thirty years old though?<br /><br />AMIR: Uh huh.<br /><br />JAKE: Almost thirty one?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />AMIR: Am I really on the front page?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, it's on the front page but you-<br /><br />AMIR: My name?<br /><br />JAKE: Yup.<br /><br />AMIR: On the front page of REDDIT?<br /><br />(AMIR's crying turns into laughter)<br /><br />AMIR: A hah hah hah hah hah hah.

No! Enough is enough! I take a scalpel, blind old Parm and I am out of there. Unfortunately, for me, I'm too weak, tired, scared and lame to get much further than the front of the inside of the van. Erstwhile, Parm is on in the back, rufflin' around, swearin' to the only Pagan god he believes in that he's gonna have my head in a jar for what I done to him, RE, blinding him with a scalpel.<br /><br />JAKE: Was it worth it?<br /><br />AMIR: Let me work it, ha ha.<br /><br />(JAKE shakes his head, AMIR whispers 'wow')<br /><br />JAKE: All this destruction.<br /><br />AMIR: It was nerf ifinifin when yet and you're not even cracking up-<br /><br />JAKE: This carnage...<br /><br />AMIR: Yup, a smile.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, was it worth changing your stupid nose over?<br /><br />AMIR: If you're talking about blinding Parm then you should know that he was nearly blind to begin with, okay?

And- by the way- why would you let a blind person operate on your face?<br /><br />(AMIR's phone rings)<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, speak o' the devil, He he.

Strategy!<br /><br />JAKE: No, it wasn't strategy! Okay? Just-- jump up and down, be happy, at least act shocked. Okay? You noseless ass!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, excuse me! What's that supposed to mean? Is that some kind of dig at my nose?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! Obviously! It wasn't thinly veiled!<br /><br />AMIR: I can't handle this right now! I gotta go back to the store and get the numbers on these tickets to match the one on the site!<br /><br />JAKE: Great, so they don't match right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Not right now! But I have a feeling if a guy who just won three hundred and thirty-three million dollars waltzed in there, [picking at his scabs] they'll pretty much do whatever the hell he asks them to.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please just focus on getting your face better and stop scratching your nose?<br /><br />AMIR: It just itches a lot, okay?

Unfortunately, she's uh... she is no longer available. Alright. Thank you. Thank you so much for calling. Bye, hun.

I don't think I want to know.<br /><br />AMIR: Here's what I do: I, uh, put a nice leather couch up on Craigslist saying it's available for free to a good home. You know, I even peppered in some really believable details, like \"I'm moving; I don't have a place for it,\" et cetera, yada yada.<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Why\" what?<br /><br />JAKE: What do you mean, \"Why what\"? You just told me something really mean-spirited and weird that you do, so I asked you why.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! [laughs] No, I just, uh, I like to let people down. I like to hear people's disappointed voices, I guess. I don't know if that makes me weird or whatever.<br /><br />JAKE: Weird? It makes you borderline psychotic!<br /><br />[The phone rings again.]<br /><br />AMIR: Shit... can you get that?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not gonna answer your phone.

Alright, well my first question is usually \"Why do you want the couch?\" ...Oh, your daughter's going away to college and she really needs a good couch? [laughs] That's really sweet. [whispering, to Jake] Watch this! [on the phone] Unfortunately, the couch is unavailable! Yes, it is because of how you answered the question. [laughs] No, no, I'm not being cute with you, uh... you really-- you disappointed your daughter on this one. Alright. Okay. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye then. [hangs up, resumes washing the bowl]<br /><br />JAKE: She asked if you were being cute with her?<br /><br />AMIR: I told her I was being \"cheeky\".<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't. I'm sitting right here. That's not what you said.<br /><br />AMIR: I said that. I said I was being cheeky.<br /><br />JAKE: You suck. You really do. You suck; you're not a good guy.<br /><br />AMIR: God forbid I have some fun at work!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! God does forbid this! Your reverse prank-calling people, and your fucked-up bait-and-switch with these evil mind games. Using a work phone, by the way! You don't even have the Goddamn courtesy to use your cell phone?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, because I don't want people to know my personal number!<br /><br />JAKE: Right, I get that, but you shouldn't be spending this much time and effort just to piss people off.<br /><br />[The phone rings. Amir grunts in frustration, then points at Jake expectantly.]<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you think I'll answer it? [Amir puts the bowl back in the bucket] The bowl's clean.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass! Ass! Ass!<br /><br />JAKE: You are.<br /><br />AMIR: [picking up the phone] Hey! Oh my God, speak of the devil! Mickey, my friend!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: You're in my apartment, Mickey, right? Alright, you rented a U-Haul, Mickey, the biggest one? You got past my doorman, Mickey? You found the key that I left under the floor mat, Mickey? Okay, open the front door to my apartment, Mickey, and you will find a tastefully distressed, beautifully restored, Danish, modern, touch of class for your ass-- there is no couch, Mickey! [laughs] It was all a mind game, Mickey! A fuckin' riddle, Mickey.<br /><br />JAKE: You know what, that's not a riddle, and did you do one work thing today? Did you answer a single email? Why'd you bring that bucket--<br /><br />AMIR: Mickey! Mickey, Mickey, Mickey... no no, you have to get out of my apartment, Mickey. Okay? I'm sorry, but you are officially trespassing, Mickey, and I have a good mind to call the police about it.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you left him a key. That's not exactly trespassing.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh. Oh! Oh God, Mickey-- No no no, I can hear-- Oh, I can hear you breaking stuff, Mickey! Please... Mickey, Mickey, I'm begging you, no no no no no-- Ohhhh God, that was the sound of my plasma TV against the tile floor, Mickey! What are you doing, Mickey? Don't do anything you can't take back, Mickey. Oh, Mickey, I'm begging you.<br /><br />JAKE: You say \"Mickey\" so much when you talk to him, it's crazy.<br /><br />AMIR: [still pleading] Mickey!

I, uh... made my own bread last night?<br /><br />JAKE: Are you asking me a question?<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly out of breath] Yeah, I just figured, uh, why not? [unwrapping and holding up a loaf of bread] I've been, uh, interested in that... kind of thing for a while now, so... ta-dah!<br /><br />JAKE: Wow... okay. [gives a thumbs-up] Nice, bud.<br /><br />AMIR: [still out of breath] Yeah, last night for dinner, I was, uh, jonesing for, like, a grilled cheese sandwich, you know. So I open the door and I just see, like, uh, cheddar?<br /><br />JAKE: Just make them sentences instead of questions. Statements, okay? [Amir nods] You're telling me a story; you're not asking me.<br /><br />AMIR: And I had, um... [pause] tomatoes?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Did you have it or not? I don't know.<br /><br />AMIR: I had tomatoes?<br /><br />JAKE: Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: But hey! No bread, so I, uh...

You figure it out, and you get it done.\" So, uh... let me cut you off a slice, huh? [grabbing a knife]<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? I-- you know, I appreciate the offer. I actually am just not that hungry.<br /><br />AMIR: [sawing the bread loaf] Come on, please? It'll mean a lot to me if you... try a slice!<br /><br />JAKE: No, I know it would mean a lot to you.

Really hard.<br /><br />AMIR: Well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.<br /><br />JAKE: This is chalk!<br /><br />AMIR: That is uncalled for! It is chalky, to be sure, but there are some redeeming characteristics.<br /><br />JAKE: No, like this bread is legitimately chalk!

I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!<br /><br />AMIR: Appreciated!<br /><br />JAKE: Never a compliment.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam! [Handing Jake a plastic container with a live rabbit sitting in it] Yeah! Just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread. [laughing] Now you have me saying \"chalk\", ya dingbat!<br /><br />JAKE: How?<br /><br />AMIR: No-- I don't know how! You said \"chalk\", and then suddenly I'm saying \"chalk\" instead of \"bread\". It's a whole thing.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?<br /><br />AMIR: It is jam! You just press its head against the bread-- not chalk mind you-- [laughs] and then you use a knife to sort of squeeze its little jam insides out of its anus onto the cha-- [pause] bread, oh my God, I hate you!<br /><br />[Jake stares, dumbfounded, at Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: Here!

I think so.<br /><br />AMIR: To blast me?<br /><br />JAKE: Blast you on a Tuesday.<br /><br />AMIR: On the day I move to The Angels?<br /><br />JAKE: I'll help you with your stuff.<br /><br />[Jake grabs the box.

You have no possessions?<br /><br />AMIR: No possessions? There's a sandwich bag!<br /><br />JAKE: A s-- yes! Exactly! You have a sandwich bag! You worked here for eight fucking years!<br /><br />AMIR: It's odds and ends, mostly!<br /><br />JAKE: It's really light! You know, considering the amount of time you spent here, at this desk. No backpack? No bag?<br /><br />AMIR: I pack light.<br /><br />JAKE: You didn't pack at all! You packed-- [shakes the bag] --it sounds like grapes and raisins, mostly.<br /><br />AMIR: [grabbing the bag] Enough, alright? Enough.<br /><br />JAKE: Right. [pointing to the OZENENZ label] \"Odds and ends\", by the way, is not one word. You, uh... you spelled this more than wrong.<br /><br />[As Jake and Amir walk away, the focus lingers on their desk.]<br /><br />[Jake is accompanying Amir on his way out. They are in the elevator.]<br /><br />AMIR: It's been ace working with you.<br /><br />[Jake pauses, but Amir begins talking over him the moment he responds.]<br /><br />JAKE: Man, that was lame. It was so lame. It made me uncomfortable. / AMIR: Ass, ass, ass for not laughing at that? It was a callback!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay.

What are you talking about? Just 'cause I'm gonna be in LA doesn't mean that we're not gonna work together anymore!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it does.<br /><br />AMIR: How frickin' so?<br /><br />JAKE: How not?

Don't yell at me that you know when you don't!<br /><br />AMIR: Congratulations! Time! You just ruined my last day on Earth here in six minutes flat? No! Six minutes bumpy!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm trying to tell you that I'm gonna drive you to LA.<br /><br />AMIR: In what?<br /><br />JAKE: [pointing to an RV parked across the street] In that.<br /><br />AMIR: ...What is that?<br /><br />JAKE: It's an RV!<br /><br />AMIR: We're driving across the country in an RV?<br /><br />JAKE: Eight days of adventure.<br /><br />AMIR: Just you and me?<br /><br />JAKE: Just me and you.<br /><br />AMIR: [taken aback] Wow...

I'm not going Dutch with you on that!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm not asking you to go Dutch-- you know what? Never mind, man. Just have-- have fun in California.<br /><br />AMIR: No, no no no, come back, come on, yeah, I'm excited. Big adventure. Hurrah.<br /><br />JAKE: You're making it worse.<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? No no no, this is good. You'll make it up to me along the way.<br /><br />[Amir heads off-screen toward the RV.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh sheesh, y'all! 'twas a road trip!<br /><br />[Off-screen, there are tires squealing and horns honking.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh!<br /><br />AMIR: [off-screen] Whoa!

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] Viva... Las Jake and! Amir! Damn it.<br /><br />JAKE: Bad execution. Bad idea.<br /><br />AMIR: Keep it rolling!<br /><br />[Amir is in a bathtub in a fancy hotel suite, where a bikini-clad girl is massaging his shoulders. Jake comes in.]<br /><br />AMIR: I woke up in a used Bugatti!<br /><br />JAKE: We have to leave!<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse us.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, actually, you know what? Excuse us. Can me and Amir talk alone for a second?<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa! Anything you can say in front of me, you can say in front of Kat!<br /><br />LYDIA: Uh, my name's Lydia.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry. [to Jake] In front of Kat!<br /><br />JAKE: Lydia.<br /><br />AMIR: Who?<br /><br />JAKE: You know what, forget it. You showed up on the casino floor last night, drunker than I've ever seen anyone.<br /><br />AMIR: I was blackout... with my cack out!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, it was. You were wearing a leather jacket, a French beret, and nothing else.<br /><br />[Amir lifts his crotch out of the water. He's completely naked.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: [disgusted] Oh! Warts!<br /><br />AMIR: No!<br /><br />JAKE: You jumped on the roulette table, instantly pulled your hamstring, but you decided to power through.<br /><br />[Amir smirks at Lydia.]<br /><br />JAKE: You said \"I'm the maitre d'! Who wants fish and chips?\" You pointed up at the rafters, like a weakling Babe Ruth, you pulled out a flounder or a... or a sea bass or something...<br /><br />[Amir is now wearing Lydia's shades over his glasses.]<br /><br />JAKE: You tossed a thousand dollars' worth of chips in the air, and you hit it across the casino floor like... l-- like you were, like you were playing Tee Ball or something!<br /><br />[Amir and Lydia laugh. Lydia is wearing Amir's glasses, and her shades are missing.]<br /><br />JAKE: Then, you tried to charge what you thought was the mound, and you ended up hitting an elderly Walmart greeter on vacation with her dying husband. Closed-fisted.<br /><br />AMIR: [wearing both glasses and shades again] Flounder!<br /><br />JAKE: I said flounder!<br /><br />AMIR: [wearing just his normal glasses] You said sea bass! ...Sea bass!<br /><br />JAKE: Security was called, but you were covered in fish grease, naturally, so you were able to slip through their arms. The pit boss announced a rousing game of \"catch the slimy Jew\", and a group of Asian businessmen bet against you, and won, when you ran full-speed, head-first into a Sex and the City slot machine.<br /><br />AMIR: That was a classic Samantha move. I'll admit it. I'll be the first to admit it!<br /><br />JAKE: There was a deafening crack, [Amir pulls a face] and everybody started to surround what they were sure-- what they hoped, actually-- was a dead body...<br /><br />[Amir is wearing the glasses and shades again.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...until you awoke mid-sentence, suing the casino, which I guess is when they upgraded you to this ridiculous suite.<br /><br />AMIR: [with normal glasses] Thus concludes your tale of woe and worry, but alas, everything worked in the end! [picks up a handful of bubbles] Bubble bath! Bubble bubble bubble bath. [blows them at Jake]<br /><br />JAKE: No it didn't! Security took you up here and started showing you suite after suite, but it was clear that you had taken this... miraculous turn of events for... more than granted! You kept on claiming \"none of these rooms are Mac Daddy enough!\" Finally, in this one, you demanded to know whether the balcony was stable or not. When the concierge went out there, you locked the door behind her...<br /><br />[Amir smirks at Lydia, who is wearing his glasses.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...and then, in a final brazen act of cowardice, you tried to set the room on fire. Unsuccessfully.<br /><br />AMIR: [with his normal glasses] Except I burned my finger, okay? If I may be so bold as to ask: how is that fair?<br /><br />JAKE: That is a bold question, but it is actually not fair, because in a fair world, you would be dead.<br /><br />AMIR: You don't have to be a roach about it!<br /><br />JAKE: Finally, delirious with anger or maybe possessed by the devil, you barrel-rolled down the escalator back onto the casino floor, in nothing but an open bathrobe and a cowboy hat. You yelled \"I'm gonna buy a blood diamond worth of blow! Who's coming back to my room with me?\"<br /><br />[Amir blows more bubbles toward Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: That's when Lydia-- who, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her: Lydia, I can only assume you're a garbage-can whore-- came back up to the room. By the way, honey, there's no blow up here. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, but--<br /><br />[Lydia jumps out of the tub and begins strangling Jake.]<br /><br />LYDIA: What did you say? [to Amir] You promised! [continues screaming at Jake]<br /><br />JAKE: What? [to Amir] You said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her!<br /><br />AMIR: Kat! I said you could say anything you wanted to in front of Kat! That's Lydia! She's a feisty one. This [gesturing to another bikini-clad girl showing up] is Kat!<br /><br />KAT: Did you say something about Lydia, motherfucker?<br /><br />[Kat begins yelling at Jake and choking him as well.]<br /><br />END",

THAT depends on whether or not...<br /><br />Jake throws the cube at Amir. It hits him in the nose. Amir clutches his nose<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake playing with the cube:<br /><br />Jake accidently drops the cube and it shatters off screen.

But it's a reminder for me to not be such a bitchly. I'm a little ashamed about it but I keep it on.<br /><br />JAKE: Listen to your voice.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't let it get to that octave.<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake throwing the badge down:<br /><br />Jake pulls out a gold watch<br /><br />JAKE (O.S.): This is a Rolex!<br /><br />CUT TO: Clip from 'Jake and Amir: Rolex':<br /><br />Jake is sitting at his desk holding up the watch<br /><br />JAKE: It's a Rolex, buddy!<br /><br />AMIR: You know how you're always like, uh, 'what time is it?'

I'm sorry for that that was obviously a little too much. [Simultaneously] JAKE: You just yelled cunt in the office. How is that okay? Alright, you know what?<br /><br />CUT TO: Jake pulling Amir's canyon note out of the bag:<br /><br />JAKE pulls the note out which says:<br /><br />FUCK OFF JAKE!!<br /><br />YOU RAT COWARD!Jake sighs and returns the note. He gets up and walks away<br /><br />In the new LA office boardroom. Employees are standing around chatting. Amir enters.<br /><br />AMIR (singing): Make way, for prince Amir...<br /><br />The employees start booing and throwing paper at Amir. Someone pulls a chair out from under him and he falls down. Everyone cheers and laughs. Someone helps Amir up and then spits in his face before another employee staples his neck<br /><br />AMIR: Ow! Ow!<br /><br />Jake runs in<br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Hey! Come on! What are you guys doing? This is insane, it's no way to treat somebody on their first day of work.

He took a real big leap of faith coming out here and... the least you guys could do is give him a fresh start. (Looking at Amir) I know one guy in this office who will.<br /><br />EMPLOYEE 1 (coughing): Loser!<br /><br />EMPLOYEE 2: Nice!

This is insane!<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! A Rubik's cube.<br /><br />Amir starts fake crying<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, shut the fuck up. Alright, tell you what man, the RV is outside!<br /><br />AMIR: Enough.<br /><br />JAKE: I can move back to New York.

IT? Yeah, this is Jake Amir Blumenfeldwitz from the fifth floor? [lifting an old printer onto his desk] I have a brand new, heavily used 1982 Inkjet printer!<br /><br />JAKE: How is that brand new?<br /><br />AMIR: Brand new ink! [on the phone] Sorry. [to Jake again] Brand new ink! Okay? Yeah, the cyan was replaced last week, but the yellow and magenta are butt-old!<br /><br />JAKE: So then the ink's not brand new either.<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] That's right, I desire to connect. So why don't you come upstairs and hook a printa up!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, there's a lot of mouse droppings in there.<br /><br />AMIR: That's right!<br /><br />JAKE: What do you even need to print?<br /><br />AMIR: Travel much?<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: Boarding passes... asses!

So you can jack my shit, jack my boarding passes?<br /><br />JAKE: Come on.<br /><br />AMIR: [chuckling] Soon you'll be... spending cross-cuntinental trips on my dime? Wh-wha-what, Christmas in Maui?

[long pause] Someone absolutely has.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding his cheek] To strike me like you did showed a lack of tact, and you came off like a classless ass, and that's the facts, Jack.<br /><br />JAKE: For as dumb as you are, you're pretty good at rhyming.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, I appreciate your attempt to mediate and alleviate what you've done to me to date, but it's a little... too little too late.<br /><br />[Amir is tucking his head between his legs, and straining to move further forward.]<br /><br />AMIR: [grunting] Come on, you little pussy! Get... ah! Aw, shit!<br /><br />AMIR: Fill out a bracket, huh? I say fack it! Nah!<br /><br />JAKE: \"Fack it, nah\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, fack it.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah? You wanna say \"fack it\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Fack it! Nah!<br /><br />JAKE: Then get out! ...Why don't you get out? Leave! You say \"fack it\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: Right?<br /><br />AMIR: Relax.<br /><br />JAKE: You want to--<br /><br />[Amir is forcing his head between his legs again.]<br /><br />AMIR: Fuck.<br /><br />AMIR: Let's get high. Right now. I swear, my picks will make more sense if we're baked!<br /><br />JAKE: Well, they couldn't make less sense currently. You have in your final four Gonzaga, a picture of a porcupine, the number eleven, and jam.<br /><br />[Jake dabs his finger on Amir's bracket, coming away with a smear of jam. He tastes it.]<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, enough-- Hey! No eating! ...No cheating!<br /><br />[Amir has his head between his legs again. Jake is taking a picture of him.]<br /><br />AMIR: [grunting] Stop!<br /><br />AMIR: St. Louis, St. Joseph... what is this, a fucking, like, a... [laughs] ...I thought this... what is it, like, a-- a fucking... [making wild hand motions]<br /><br />JAKE: Wow, dude. Try to work on these jokes a little bit.<br /><br />[Amir has his head between his legs.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Time.<br /><br />AMIR: Damn it!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, dude, so you can't suck your own dick at all, let alone to completion, in less than three minutes.<br /><br />AMIR: Double or nothing, okay? Anybody else's dick. Any dick.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, stop it. Stop it. I win the bet.<br /><br />AMIR: [collecting his and Jake's brackets] Alright, so these are them.<br /><br />JAKE: That's it.<br /><br />AMIR: Our final brackets. Let me just file them under \"E\" for evidence! [rips the brackets up]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh-- come on!<br /><br />AMIR: Because you're under arrest! [grabs Jake]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, that type of shit might fly in NYC, but this is illegal gambling, alright? We don't look too kindly on rinks!<br /><br />END",

I post about these things pretty often, actually, they're-- [chuckling] --they're actually really funny! They're great!

You post about these stories all the time on Facebook! Your last one just says \"Buck Fieber\"... nice.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious, dude. Buck him! Yeah, why does he get all this attention? He doesn't deserve it! Just... just thinking about it, literally all the time, makes me sick to my stomach!<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you're giving him a lot of attention.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, 'cause he's a basket case! He's a car crash, and I can't look away! Also, belieb it or not, I'm... I'mma kind of obsessed with this little fucker.<br /><br />JAKE: Of course I belieb that!

Amir and Murph come up behind him, wearing oven mitts and carrying a giant pot of pea soup.]<br /><br />AMIR: Who wants soup?<br /><br />AMIR/MURPH: April Fools!<br /><br />[Amir and Murph dump all of the soup on top of Jake, who lets out a blood-curdling scream.]<br /><br />[Cut to Jake lying on his stomach on a stretcher. His shirt is off, and his back is covered in cloth bandages.

Did not expect or deserve that tongue-lashing!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what I didn't expect or deserve? To be burned alive.

He looks around idly for a bit, then bends over and puts his face next to Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: Want to know the worst part?<br /><br />JAKE: I know the worst part. It was the feeling of the flesh falling off my back, after--<br /><br />AMIR: It's that April Fools is like ruined now almost. [standing back up] Not in a good way, either.<br /><br />JAKE: How can you ruin something in a good way?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm just saying that I feel like every April you'll be reminded of this little snafu, and I won't be able to play another epic prank on you without this green cloud hovering over us!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you know what, dude? I think I will remember this every April. I'll remember this every week, every day, for the rest of my life.

Why?<br /><br />[Murph stands up, and rips one of the bandages off of Jake's back.]<br /><br />JAKE: [screaming] Owwwww, I'm sorry!<br /><br />MURPH: [leaning over] I don't think Amir could hear you.<br /><br />JAKE: [whimpering] Ohh...<br /><br />MURPH: Because you were yelling like a bitch.<br /><br />AMIR: I guess kinda I could hear him...<br /><br />JAKE: [high-pitched stammering] Yeah, he could hear me! Hear that? He said he could hear me!<br /><br />AMIR: ...though Murph does raise a good point that it was a little bit masked by, b-- by the, by the bitchly screaming.<br /><br />MURPH: So let's try that again, Jake. [Jake whimpers again] This time, without the bitchly screaming.<br /><br />JAKE: Weak! I'm so--<br /><br />[Murph tears another bandage off.]<br /><br />JAKE: [screaming, crying] Owwwwwww!<br /><br />MURPH: Amir, do you accept that?<br /><br />AMIR: I mostly do, but maybe not completely, because he didn't finish the sentence. He was like, \"I'm sorr-- aaaaah!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Man, this is so fucked! Even for you guys! ...It's too dark! I don't like this!<br /><br />MURPH: Amir, should we give Jake one more chance to apologize like a man...

I feel no pain. What are you doing?<br /><br />MURPH: [smiling calmly] I'm applying warming jelly to your back. Jake, the soup wasn't burning hot... it was freezing cold. [Amir nods] You went into shock, and... we told you your body was covered in third-degree burns. [staring off into the distance, still massaging Jake] It's funny, you know?

[As he speaks, he tries to put his arm around Jake, but Jake keeps fighting him off.] We're currently inside a five-bedroom, six-bathroom colonial townhouse, in Williamsburg, Virginia.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, can you stop doing that? We're not in a townhouse.<br /><br />BEN: Okay, that's my fault. It's the wrong listing. [flipping through listings] Aaah!

Haaaaaakuna matata! Nothing happens. That's just to scare it, to get ready. Cut to seventeen hours later: I'm in my bed, shittin' my balls off. Moving on!<br /><br />BEN: I shouldn't tell you this--<br /><br />AMIR: Oooooh, do it--<br /><br />BEN: Okay, fine! Do you want to know who lived here before you guys?<br /><br />JAKE: Sure.<br /><br />BEN: Have you heard of a little band called the Rolling Stones?<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, yeah.<br /><br />BEN: Well, the serial killer who lived here loves the Rolling Stones.

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: Hey, you're watching Jake and Amir. Who needs Jake? [laughing, then crying] Where is he?<br /><br />[Jake is in an office room, on his phone. Amir materializes from nothing into the chair beside him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh hey there!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ, dude!<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: What are you?<br /><br />AMIR: Been thinking a bit about poster ideas; thought I could run a few by you.<br /><br />JAKE: Poster ideas.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't you think we're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point?<br /><br />AMIR: I think I can make 'em funny!<br /><br />AMIR: We should come up with a ratings system. So instead of you saying, like, \"this is good, this is bad\", you'll be like \"this is amber, this is taupe\".<br /><br />JAKE: So taupe is bad?<br /><br />AMIR: No no no, taupe is great. Amber is just better than that, and if something is ultimate, it's gray.<br /><br />AMIR: It's a poster of Jordan, right-- Air Jordan, probably-- and he's soaring through the sky and slammin' it home! [putting his hand on Jake's shoulder]<br /><br />JAKE: Stop touching me.<br /><br />AMIR: Pretty--<br /><br />JAKE: Pretty unoriginal.<br /><br />AMIR: Pretty forcefully. Is what I was gonna say. Don't taint my ideas with your negative shit feedback... Christ!<br /><br />AMIR: Uh, it's a poster of dank weed, you know, like sticky bud, and there's, like, a girl in a bikini.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright. Taupe.<br /><br />AMIR: Pretty good. Agreed.<br /><br />JAKE: That's the lowest I could rate it.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh?<br /><br />AMIR: [taps Jake's shoulder] Alright, it's a poster of a clock, right--<br /><br />JAKE: Don't touch me.<br /><br />AMIR: --but instead of the hour marks, it's little beers... except at six o'clock, it's a little ears. 'Cause listen up! It's beer-thirty! And I'm thirsty!<br /><br />JAKE: That's the only time that it wouldn't be beer-thirty. It would be ear-thirty.<br /><br />AMIR: Amber.<br /><br />JAKE: ...How dare you.<br /><br />AMIR: See if you can wrap your twat around this one: it's a psychedelic black-light poster for a little band I like to call... the Grateful Dead! [pulls a constipated-looking face]<br /><br />JAKE: That's a really horrible face-- and none of these ideas have been original, okay? It sounds like you want to just open up a poster store.<br /><br />AMIR: That's actually a pretty dece idea. Maybe a poster store in the front, a cool cafe in the back, and a little spot to put air in your tires if you ride a bike!<br /><br />JAKE: God, you're a bad businessman.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm not a businessman. I'm a businesswoman.<br /><br />AMIR: It's a picture of a ninety-eight-year-old dude on a toilet, right? Caption: \"I'm gettin' too old for this shit!\"<br /><br />JAKE: That one's kind of funny.<br /><br />AMIR: Well that one already exists too! So all this shit about me not selling \"originals\"? [doing air quotes] \"You're dumb\"!<br /><br />JAKE: Why am I here?<br /><br />AMIR: ...What?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm actually on the fence about even pitching this one, 'cause it's so, like, hyper-offensive.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, well, so don't say anything--<br /><br />AMIR: But it's a [long-sustained bleep, accompanied by a black censor bar over Amir's mouth]<br /><br />[As Amir describes his poster, he makes violent hand gestures. Jake tries shushing him, then looks around, then tries to interject. None of this is audible over the censor bleep. Eventually Jake slaps Amir to shut him up.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Taupe.<br /><br />AMIR: So it's a poster so shiny and reflective that it shows you a mirror image of yourself when you stare at it.<br /><br />JAKE: A mirror.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say your name. You're pitching me a mirror.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Yes, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Taupe.<br /><br />AMIR: Dope.<br /><br />AMIR: I can has cheezburger?<br /><br />JAKE: Is that a pitch?<br /><br />AMIR: No, I'm just hungry, and I was wondering if I can has a... has a cheezburger, actually. I... I hasn't has one in a while, and I was... simply... curious as to whether or not I can has one. A cheezburger.<br /><br />AMIR: This one's less of a poster and more of a drink, but it's like a... orange juice and soda water.<br /><br />JAKE: That's entirely a drink. You just pitched me orange soda.<br /><br />AMIR: I-- it's just that I'm starving, and I feel like I can has... a whole lot of food, but more than anything else, I... I cazn't has a cheezburger. In fact, I... I cheezn't has a cazburger in quite a while, factually.<br /><br />JAKE: I don't care what you eat.<br /><br />AMIR: I caz hoping I caz has one. With cheez.<br /><br />AMIR: It's called the Guide to British Smiles, and it's just famous Englishmen and pictures of their fucked-up teeth. It's like half social commentary, half me just being a little bit of a dickling.<br /><br />JAKE: No, you're just always being a dickling.<br /><br />AMIR: [mouthing] Wow. [writing]<br /><br />JAKE: Still wrote \"amber\".<br /><br />[Amir has a cheeseburger.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oooh, I shouldn't has this! I cazn't has this cheezburger! It'll give me bad cholesterol! I can has bad cholesterol?<br /><br />JAKE: I think you're has-ing a stroke.<br /><br />AMIR: This one's half poster, half beverage. Okay? It's called an Arnold Palmer!<br /><br />JAKE: That's all beverage. It's half iced tea, half lemonade.<br /><br />AMIR: Just tell me if you like it or not!<br /><br />JAKE: It's a good idea, but it's not yours.<br /><br />AMIR: Winning! [gives Jake a thumbs-up]<br /><br />AMIR: It's a 1988 Lamborghini Countach, parked on a hill during a sunset, cherry red! And guess who gets to drive it!<br /><br />JAKE: You?<br /><br />AMIR: Heck no! ...Me in ten years!<br /><br />AMIR: ...Milk?<br /><br />JAKE: God-- can I see your notebook?<br /><br />AMIR: You'll never understand my scatterbrain!<br /><br />JAKE: [flipping through the pages] Yeah, just page after page of drink ideas.<br /><br />AMIR: I can has my notebook back now?<br /><br />JAKE: You think you invented milk?<br /><br />AMIR: Dad?<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, just trying to organize my thoughts here. Would you say your top three choices so far have been psychedelic poster, milk, and mirror?<br /><br />JAKE: No.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. That'll suit me well for my first round of funding; the angel round, as it were. By the way, how much could I put you down for? It's a big pie, so feel free to ask for a small little slice.<br /><br />JAKE: Zero.<br /><br />AMIR: That fucking hurts to hear.<br /><br />END",

Amir is driving. Amir looks over at Jake expectantly.]<br /><br />JAKE: Look-- [pointing at the road] ...Jesus.<br /><br />[Amir gestures at somebody outside.]<br /><br />AMIR: Learn how to drive, shitbird!<br /><br />JAKE: That guy's walking.<br /><br />AMIR: Call me a shitbird again. Call it to my face and see what happens.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! And last time I checked...<br /><br />JAKE: \"I'm have a pussy\"?<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] ...I'm have a pussy. Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you've said that before.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right. Can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? Alright? Music helps me drive!<br /><br />JAKE: Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry if music distracts me! I think that's pretty normal, actually.<br /><br />JAKE: Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.<br /><br />AMIR: [mocking Jake] I-- I--I know how to drive, alright? I'm a regular James Deen.<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Jerk.<br /><br />AMIR: I can't... you know what?... I can't see anything. I think I need my sunglasses.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--<br /><br />AMIR: No, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em.<br /><br />[Amir leans way back into the backseat to look for his sunglasses. Jake grabs the wheel.]<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, hey-- hey-- dude! Hey! Idiot!<br /><br />AMIR: I got 'em, dude! I g--<br /><br />JAKE: You idiot!<br /><br />AMIR: Why am I an idiot? Okay? There's a lot of glare. It'll be much safer if I just find my shades!<br /><br />JAKE: Eyes on the road, buddy.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't need 'em on the road, buddy! Alright? Relax. I--<br /><br />[Jake shushes Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] Beware, beware, beware...<br /><br />JAKE: Find the glasses.<br /><br />AMIR: [singing] ...of a woman with a broken fart! [farts loudly]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh! Smelly!<br /><br />[Amir sits back in his seat, wearing heart-shaped sunglasses.]<br /><br />AMIR: Got 'em, baby!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />AMIR: Pussy-whipped much?<br /><br />JAKE: ...What?<br /><br />AMIR: I swear, dude. You let women walk all over you. You gotta--<br /><br />JAKE: I don't-- ...stop it. Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: Okay...<br /><br />JAKE: I don't feel like having a conversation right now.<br /><br />AMIR: Me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. [pronouncing \"page\" in French]<br /><br />JAKE: Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.<br /><br />AMIR: Fine. [pause] It's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive. [chuckles] Was sittin' in the same seat you were. If you can belee dat!<br /><br />JAKE: I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--<br /><br />AMIR: Cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. \"Loser has to teach Queen Dweeb to drive!\" That's what they said.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Queen Dweeb\"?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Queen Dweeb\". That was their nickname for me. They used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?<br /><br />JAKE: ...The pit?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. They used to throw knives at me.<br /><br />JAKE: Why did you ask me about peach pits?<br /><br />AMIR: Because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...Idiot!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah?<br /><br />JAKE: Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.<br /><br />AMIR: [doing an arm signal] I use arm signals. [sticking his arm in front of Jake] Hi-ya! Less legal, sure--<br /><br />JAKE: Eyes on the road.<br /><br />AMIR: --but... way less effective, too.<br /><br />JAKE: So you said \"less\" twice, then.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. [chuckles] Oh, God, these driving lessons. Daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. \"I don't want to drive today, Papa! I can't reach the pedals!\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...Excuse me?<br /><br />AMIR: I was four.<br /><br />JAKE: God, your parents suck, dude.<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse me! Say that again! Say that again to my face and I will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!<br /><br />JAKE: Keep your eyes on the road!<br /><br />AMIR: I can't see shit, dude! These glasses are not prescription!<br /><br />JAKE: Then take them off!<br /><br />AMIR: [leaning back into the backseat again] Let me put them back in the case!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Dude!<br /><br />AMIR: What, dude! Drive, shitbird!<br /><br />JAKE: Hey! Come on!<br /><br />END",

I like... masturbating and shrimp quite a bit.<br /><br />JAKE: One of those is a hobby. The other is jerking off, and the third is just a sea creature.<br /><br />AMIR: Masturbating might actually be my favorite.

A lot of salads actually taste like shit, but I hear they're pretty good for you. Here, look.<br /><br />[Amir shoves a handful of manure into his mouth.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh, don't! Dude, no!<br /><br />AMIR: [through a mouthful of manure] This one tastes like horse manure, actually!<br /><br />JAKE: That actually is horse manure!<br /><br />AMIR: [with his mouth full] Sure tastes like it!

[pronounced \"load\"]<br /><br />AMIR: Lord?<br /><br />JAKE: Lod. L-O-D. As in she has double-D's. It's French or some shit, and I'm going to french... [miming licking breasts] ...her tits!<br /><br />AMIR: I wonder if I should get Tinder!<br /><br />JAKE: I'm gonna stop you right there. I wouldn't do that, just 'cause you're what my Tinder coach would call an app-killer. You're someone who doesn't just get left-swiped; you actually inspire people to delete the app. [laughing] You're ugly.<br /><br />AMIR: Mean!<br /><br />JAKE: Sometimes the truth hurts. You've got to embrace it. I was an app-killer myself before I met Chet, but it only cost me fifty bucks per match to become Mr. Right-Swiped!<br /><br />AMIR: Loser! You have a Tinder coach?<br /><br />JAKE: Goddamn right I do.<br /><br />AMIR: How many matches have you gotten?<br /><br />JAKE: [holding up one finger] Just the one. Just the one so far, but I've only been right-swiping for a year.<br /><br />[Amir makes an incredulous face. Jake mocks him defensively.]<br /><br />AMIR: Long time.<br /><br />JAKE: The trick? Shirtless pics!

[dancing, trying to sing the sax line of \"Talk Dirty\" by Jason Derulo] Da-na-na, da, da-na-na-na-naaa, na-na-na, na, naaa-na-na!<br /><br />AMIR: ...She's a bot.<br /><br />JAKE: What the fuck did you just say?<br /><br />AMIR: ...I mean, it's clear to me--<br /><br />JAKE: Whoa, buddy! What the fuck did you just say about my girlfriend?<br /><br />AMIR: These photos are of--<br /><br />JAKE I'm gonna tell you one thing right now, before you say what I think you're about to say. This \"bot\", as you're gonna callously call her? She might be my future wife, and the mother to my future children! So please, I beg of you, actually I demand of you, to proceed with reverence.<br /><br />AMIR: All--<br /><br />JAKE: Tread lightly. Fucker.<br /><br />AMIR: All these photos are of different strippers.<br /><br />JAKE: Meaning?<br /><br />AMIR: Meaning, this one's blonde. This one's a redhead. This one's Asian!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah! Lod keeps you guessing, man. That's why I dig her. Plus we really connected over chat! Things got real!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, she wrote \"Hey, cutie. Want to see me tonight? Go to livecamgirlwhores.co.nz and enter your billing info.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Yes! I kind of like when girls ask for what they want. I think that's sexy. Maybe you disagree.<br /><br />AMIR: You responded \"I don't have a credit card. Can I PayPal or Venmo you? I think this could be the real deal, and I'd hate to lose you over a technicality, Lod.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry for me telling her what I want too!<br /><br />AMIR: She responds \"Sorry, cutie. No cash. Need billing info.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Fair.<br /><br />AMIR: You write \"Shit, shit, shit. Okay, calling my dad. Do not hang up, please.\"<br /><br />JAKE: I was worried about losing her.<br /><br />AMIR: She writes \"Don't worry, cutie. This is a text conversation. There is no hanging up.\"<br /><br />JAKE: She's there for me when I'm feeling weak.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright...<br /><br />JAKE: By the way, I resent the implication that I'm not good at texting. I'm a Casanova in that regard.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, you finally respond \"My dad yelled at me, but I cried, cried, cried, and my mommy was able to make things right by snagging a pic of Dad's CC.\"<br /><br />JAKE: There we go. Everything's right in the world.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Sending you some major coin as we squeak.\"<br /><br />JAKE: She deserved it.<br /><br />AMIR: She says nothing!<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't have to.<br /><br />AMIR: You write again \"I love you.\"<br /><br />JAKE: 'Cause I do.<br /><br />AMIR: She said nothing.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't have to.<br /><br />AMIR: You write \"I love you so much, Lod.\"<br /><br />JAKE: I do. I love her so much.<br /><br />AMIR: She says nothing.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't have to.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, 'cause then you said \"I'll see you tonight on the cam. I love you so much, Lod.\"<br /><br />JAKE: What don't you understand, dude? She's playing hard to wet!<br /><br />AMIR: She just wrote back \"Can't do tonight, cutie.\"<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: \"I withdrew a thousand dollars from the account as a holding fee for next week.\"<br /><br />JAKE: No...<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: No!<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Lod!<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Why, Lod?<br /><br />END",

Paul Briganti is leading the meeting.]<br /><br />PAUL: Okay, guys. Table read time. As always, let's get Amir's out of the way first.<br /><br />AMIR: Mmm. Saving the best for first, I take it.<br /><br />PAUL: Uh, okay. Amir, do you want to cast this, please?<br /><br />AMIR: [to Jake] Jake, you'll be Darryl McMillionaire, smooth-talking Wall Street agent with a heart of cold. The only thing he cares about more than money... is cash. [to Emily] And Sophie, my beautiful little peach, you shall be playing Moira Cunt, a woman so hot, she doesn't have to be smart. And news flash: ...she ain't!<br /><br />EMILY: I'm Emily.<br /><br />AMIR: You're Moira. From this moment on, I don't want you to break character until you die. You got that, \"Emily\"?<br /><br />EMILY: [as Moira Cunt] Call me Moira!<br /><br />AMIR: Who?<br /><br />PAUL: Okay, let's get started. I'll read scene direction.<br /><br />AMIR: Great.<br /><br />PAUL: \"Interior: Cash. Day. This motherfucker only cares about money. Darryl enters.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Oh, hello. Didn't see you there. You know why? I only care about one thing: pussy, money, and cash. And I'm almost out of cash.\"<br /><br />MURPH: [laughing] That's good writing.<br /><br />PAUL: Uh, \"Moira enters.\"<br /><br />EMILY: \"The name's Moira. Moira Slut.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, let me stop you right there. Uh, for anybody who's a little bit too thickheaded to get what's going on, Moira Cunt, at this moment in the script, is trying to... mask her true identity.<br /><br />EMILY: \"I say 'Moira Slut' because I'm masking my true identity.\"<br /><br />MURPH: Very good writing.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Moira Slut, why don't you get on your knees and kiss my knees? Kiss my tiny little knees.\"<br /><br />[Murph glares at Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Is this sexy to you?<br /><br />EMILY: \"I won't do it.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Not even if I give you cash?\"<br /><br />[Amir rubs his fingers together.]<br /><br />PAUL: \"Darryl holds up a laminated binder filled with every kind of bill. Twenties, fifties, even sixties and seventies. It's all good because it's all green. It's that guap shit that makes rappers' hoes go 'da-na-na, na-na-na, na'. I'd punch my mother in the gut for twenty dollars.\"<br /><br />[As the scene direction is read, Jake and Murph have a silent argument. Murph stares incredulously at Jake. Jake gestures at Amir and mouths \"He wrote it!\" Murph gestures at Emily as if to accuse Jake. Jake mimes typing on a keyboard, gestures at Amir again, and mouths \"It didn't happen. He wrote it.\"]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay guys, try not to lose your cum, uh, when you read what happens next. I know scripts don't usually get this salacious, but this is the hottest sex scene I've ever written.<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] Sex scene! Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: It's clearly not a sex scene! We're not having sex!<br /><br />PAUL: \"Darryl and Moira Clock start going to town. They're going all the way. A salad bowl is on Darryl's head like a party hat. Moira wears an ape mask and nothing else, except a shirt and pants and grandma underwear.\"<br /><br />[Jake and Murph continue arguing silently. Murph takes off his glasses. Jake mouths \"Put your glasses on.\" Murph mouths \"No. No.\"]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, that's very hot. I might lose a little cum myself!<br /><br />MURPH: It's a little too hot, don't you think, Jake?<br /><br />AMIR: Who am I to deny this on-screen chemistry?<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] Off-screen chemistry!<br /><br />JAKE: [yelling] On-screen! He said \"on-screen\", and I didn't do anything!<br /><br />PAUL: \"Moira Fudge can't take it anymore. She organisms.\"<br /><br />EMILY: \"Aaaaaah! Eee! Eee! Eee!\" [rhythmically, as Amir conducts with his hands] \"Ay, chi, pa-pi, oh, me, li-key, you, long, time! Aaaah!\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"I can't believe my eyes are rolling back in my head. I'm ecstatic to feel this. This is sex, and I am cash.\"<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] That's it!<br /><br />[Murph tears off his clothes to reveal a shark-themed singlet.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh! No, dude! No! Come on, dude.<br /><br />[Emily hands Murph a mouth guard.]<br /><br />JAKE: [defending himself with a chair] Look, get away from me, Murphy! Alright? I'll sue you, dude!<br /><br />[Murph pins Jake against the wall and tries to lift him up. Emily licks her fingers and slips her hand under the table. Murph has Jake on the floor, face-down, grabbing him by the legs.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh God, my knees! My tiny knees!<br /><br />[Murph screams furiously.]<br /><br />END",

What font are you, you dingbat?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't talk to me like that. Alright? You change moods so quickly, it's obviously a problem. Right? A version of psychosis, I think.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing again] Here! Here, I'm gonna post it to my news feed!<br /><br />JAKE: Perfect example.<br /><br />AMIR: That way, you can click on the link and take the quiz yourself!<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, do me a favor: don't say \"here\". Don't say \"here\" like you're doing me a favor. You post literally all of them to your news feed.<br /><br />AMIR: [making a goofy face] I can't help it if they're viral!<br /><br />JAKE: Get a different face.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Ouch.<br /><br />JAKE: That's one thing you can help, by the way: if they're viral.

[chuckles] Would love some feedback. \"What bean are you?\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...\"What bean are you?\"<br /><br />AMIR: Good question! ...Leema!<br /><br />JAKE: I was repeating the title in disbelief-- it's \"lima\", by the way. You're mispronouncing the bean you think you are. What possible questions could even exist on that quiz?<br /><br />AMIR: Question the first...<br /><br />JAKE: Never mind. Forget I asked.<br /><br />AMIR: \"When you walk into a club, a techno, trip-hop, euro-synth style pub, are you A: Down to clown like a kidney bean, all high and mighty.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Weird.<br /><br />AMIR: \"B: Black bean style, muy caliente from head to toe.

Do you mind if I bring that up?<br /><br />AMIR: \"A: Kidney bean slap bracelets.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Yup, just found the date of the last email you sent. May 2013. About a memorial service for Kunal Shah, that programmer who died? You wrote, \"LOL! Not going to this.

I could listen to almost any song and they'd all be more important. Why take these moronic quizzes? Why broadcast the results?<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] It's gonna sound stupid, but they help me project a self-image I didn't even know that I had! ...In this increasingly anonymous world of modern technology, these \"quizzes\" give us the only thing that any of us truly wants, which is... an identity.

Starting a DJ business.<br /><br />JAKE: That's what I guessed. Why have a conversation with you if you're just gonna--<br /><br />AMIR: [shaking with excitement] Good question! Business is booming!<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please not shake so much? Just contain the excitement. You enter every single conversation with an agenda, so, like, no matter what direction it goes--<br /><br />AMIR: Business is booming. I'm happy; you're happy for me! [laughs] I'm doing everything right now pro bono, but that doesn't mean I'm not makin' bank! [rubs his fingers together]<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it does! If you're using \"pro bono\" correctly.<br /><br />AMIR: I can't help it if my Yelp reviews suck!<br /><br />JAKE: That's one thing you can help! The reviews suck if you suck! So you improve yourself!<br /><br />AMIR: [mouthing] Wow.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm looking at them right now. \"DJ Shmumu pressed 'play' on a Spotify playlist and fainted.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: \"DJ Shmumu fainted upon arrival!\"<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: \"He woke up and tried to load a Spotify playlist, but promptly fainted again!\"<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Stop saying \"yeah\"!

I assure you she is a lovely bride, and she's gonna get the reception she deserves. I'm actually... setting up the turntables as we speak, Mickey!<br /><br />JAKE: [shaking his head] Why do you do this?<br /><br />AMIR: Not to give too much away, Mickey, but I figure we start with the Hora, move on to some playful, yet tasteful, Golden Oldies, before transitioning beautifully and seamlessly to the father-daughter dance! I believe the one you requested... [typing on his keyboard, winking to Jake] let me pull it up right now... is, uh... that's right! It's called \"I'm not actually DJing your daughter's wedding tonight, Mickey!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Here we go.<br /><br />AMIR: She's gonna be an ugly bride, Mickey, and she's probably not gonna get married, Mickey!<br /><br />JAKE: That has nothing to do with being a DJ.<br /><br />AMIR: You know why, Mickey?

In fact, Mickey... I'm fainting right now, Mickey... Mickey, help me out, Mickey.

By the way, looks like you did pack a lunch. Just a... giant bag of carrots, but still.<br /><br />AMIR: What's the point of conversation as it stands right now? I can wax poetic about a myriad of hot topics. [takes a bite of a carrot]<br /><br />PAUL: New York versus LA.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay... and what's the consensus? Just so I can play devil's advocate.<br /><br />PAT: No consensus, really. We;re just saying they're different.<br /><br />AMIR: And in terms of theses differences, are we excited or thrown by them?<br /><br />JAKE: You don't need all of the information. Okay? Just see if you can enter a conversation seamlessly.<br /><br />AMIR: [taking another bite] Easy!<br /><br />[Paul shakes his head.]<br /><br />PAT: ...Right. So... you know, New York just has a way of getting under your skin--<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling over Pat] Been thinking about setting up a home theater system shit in my den!<br /><br />JAKE: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: What do you guys think is the difference between Sonos and other leading brands like Bose? Or do y'all only like to talk about unimportant shit?<br /><br />JAKE: You know, I think your sound system is unimportant shit.<br /><br />AMIR: [gesturing with the carrots sticking straight out from his palms] Really! Because last time I checked, audio was the second-most important part of the audio-video experience.<br /><br />JAKE: Worst hands ever; stop doing that-- so it's the least important part, right?<br /><br />AMIR: I just wish we'd talk about my hobbies too, but I feel like I can't even get a word in edgewise.<br /><br />JAKE: You're dominating the conversation! What hobbies do you even have?<br /><br />AMIR: Not really a hobby, but I'm pretty good at alienating significant others. Like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, I'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... I'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely. [chuckles] Box her out physically, just so she doesn't feel like one of us.<br /><br />JAKE: Why would you think that's even close to a hobby? It's the opposite of a hobby. A hobby's an enriching way to spend your spare time, and that's just... that's tearing at the fabric of a loving relationship.<br /><br />AMIR: At least we're talking about something!<br /><br />JAKE: We were talking about something.<br /><br />PAUL: [getting up] I'm gonna...<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, of course.<br /><br />[Paul leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: Can't handle the heat, huh? F-f-f-f-fatass? [tries to clear his throat] ...I think I might be dying.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah. Chew better. Just chew it all the way 'til it's mush, and then swallow. You don't swallow early.<br /><br />AMIR: You don't have to tell me twice.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't bring an entire bag of carrots to lunch. You bring one or two. I mean, you sat down 'cause you wanted to have a conversation, right?<br /><br />AMIR: I still do. Even if it's just us three: me, you, and this thin little fatass.<br /><br />[Pat gets up and leaves.]<br /><br />JAKE: Pat... Patrick.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up two fingers] And then there were Jew. What should us two little sister-friends gab about? [takes a bite of the carrot]<br /><br />JAKE: What do you want to gab about?<br /><br />[Amir is now wearing headphones and a sleeping mask.]<br /><br />AMIR: Can't hear you! Listening to a Spotify playlist aptly named \"Songs That Pair Well with a Carrot-Based Lunch\".<br /><br />[Jake gets up and leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: Are you still in the room, fatass?<br /><br />[Amir is alone in the room.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Fatass?<br /><br />END",

Jake is reading a book.]<br /><br />AMIR: Best part of life?<br /><br />JAKE: ...spending time with friends and family--<br /><br />AMIR: Games! Jinx! [laughing]<br /><br />AMIR: The next Tiny Wings is on this list. The next Snood is on this list.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, I see that. \"Tiny Wings 2\". \"Snood 2\". You don't have the rights to either of those games.<br /><br />AMIR: Copyright infringement.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Exactly.<br /><br />AMIR: [humming the Mario theme] Doo-doot doo doot-doot doo! Doo! Jojo the Italian Plumberman.<br /><br />AMIR: Let me see your phone.<br /><br />[Jake slides his phone over to Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay.<br /><br />[Amir smashes Jake's phone with a hammer.]<br /><br />JAKE: Why.<br /><br />AMIR: What would you say if I told you I had a game that would fix this?<br /><br />JAKE: Do you?<br /><br />AMIR: Not yet.<br /><br />AMIR: Ninety-five percent of gaming happens when you're on the shitter. So this game is called \"Wipe Me\", and you get to clean your butt virtually.<br /><br />JAKE: ...As well as in real life, right?<br /><br />[Amir shrugs.]<br /><br />AMIR: Like, nobody thought to land on the Moon, and then one night, we were just there!<br /><br />JAKE: That's not how it worked. You thought we went to the Moon by accident?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm just saying let's do that, but with this fix-your-phone game!<br /><br />JAKE: Call tech support. Alright? Get my phone fixed.<br /><br />AMIR: Shut up about your phone for a second. I'm... I'm having an idea.<br /><br />[Amir is quiet, but peeing sounds are coming from under the table.]<br /><br />JAKE: I can hear you peeing.<br /><br />AMIR: You know how it's illegal to spy on people while they shit, shower, and shave?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes.<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly concerned] Really?<br /><br />[Amir covers his phone with his hand.]<br /><br />JAKE: Let me see your phone.<br /><br />AMIR: No chance in hell. That's an invasion of my privacy.<br /><br />JAKE: You're invading other people's privacy.<br /><br />AMIR: No I won't. Again. Or for the first time. I won't, and I didn't. And I haven't. Again. Or ever.<br /><br />[Amir can be heard peeing.]<br /><br />JAKE: That's a long piss.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm peeing. For a second.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! Not really a game idea, but--<br /><br />JAKE: Then I'm gonna stop you right there. It shouldn't be on this list.<br /><br />AMIR: --I shave a soul patch.<br /><br />JAKE: You're so scatterbrained. What do you do? You just sit around your apartment coming up with game ideas, when you have an idea for facial hair? You don't have to write down every dumb idea that comes into your mind!<br /><br />AMIR: And the truth finally starts pouring out!<br /><br />JAKE: I've said that. I've always said that.<br /><br />AMIR: [pounding his fist rhythmically against his chest, humming to the beat] Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, yeah...<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, so it's Spotify, but only for songs.<br /><br />JAKE: Spotify is for songs. Also, that wasn't a game.<br /><br />AMIR: Really? Because last time I checked, you play music.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Just my first critique then. Spotify's already for songs.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll put it in the \"maybe\" pile, then.<br /><br />AMIR: [still pounding a beat on his chest and humming] Hmm-mmm, alright, hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, do it too...<br /><br />AMIR: Let me tell ya, I had a lot of time to come up with game ideas as a teen. I had facial backne.<br /><br />JAKE: You mean regular acne?<br /><br />AMIR: Nope, fbackne. I'm talkin' about back zits on my face. I wish I would've had acne. Acne would have been an improvement... acne would have been nice.<br /><br />AMIR: [still pounding a beat on his chest and humming] Two hearts beating as one, hmm-mmm...<br /><br />JAKE: Say an idea, or I'm gonna leave.<br /><br />AMIR: Parcheesi.<br /><br />[Jake shakes his head.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Yeah yeah, he just, uh, he just whacked it with a hammer, and it broke. [laughing] I know! I guess he-- I guess he thought he can fix it with an app, which I don't think you can do. Could you? If you w-- even if you dreamed big? 'Cause of the Moon landings. Okay. Yeah yeah. [to Jake] You're a moron.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Oops! All Long Pieces Tetris\".<br /><br />JAKE: That actually sounds pretty satisfying.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I don't have the ability or the rights to program it! Okay? So I'm kinda stuck there, aren't I. Don't say \"nice\", if you know for a fact I'm dead to rights.<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you pitching me anything?<br /><br />AMIR: I like lists. [rifling through his paper] In fact, can I pitch you a list of list ideas that I have?<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] No, no no, he'd be honored to be on your \"Idiots of Tech Support\" blog. The name is Jacob Hurwitz, and as for the picture, I have a primo one of him taking a shit. Or a shower. Perhaps a shave. [to Jake] Hm?<br /><br />END",

Amir silently holds up a scroll.]<br /><br />JAKE: No. No, please--<br /><br />AMIR: \"Top Ten Vacation Ideas for the Summer\", by Amir Judy Blume-enfeld.<br /><br />JAKE: Tell you what-- [to others in the office] does anybody want a computer? Does anyone want a desktop? Amir doesn't use his.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number ten--\"<br /><br />JAKE: To work.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Are you feeling zen? If not, a staycation is what I recommend. Or better yet, don't be a jerk. Unwind by being a man... and goin' to work.\"<br /><br />JAKE: So your first vacation idea is not taking one. And working. Which you're not doing right now because you're sitting here, reading me this list.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number nine: Stop whining about the time. Go to work. Can you?\"<br /><br />JAKE: Can you?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Please?\"<br /><br />JAKE: These aren't even vacation ideas!<br /><br />AMIR: It's just the first two!<br /><br />JAKE: Still! They're in the top ten! They're on the list, that you called \"Vacation Ideas\"!<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number eight: You're overweight! 'Cuz you overate. Whip your butt into shape with exercise classes. That's right: a boot camp retreat, for all y'all fatasses!\"<br /><br />JAKE: What is relaxing about a boot camp? How is that a vacation?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number seven: A Sawa named Devon! This tween idol deserves that title. Shack up with 'Now and Then' co-star Devon Sawa in his Hollywood Hills bungalow! Now that sounds like a place that's... fun to go!\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...Isn't Devon Sawa dead?<br /><br />AMIR: You're thinking of Brad Renfro.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Fine.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number six: Check out Brad Renfro's dicks!\"<br /><br />[Jake grimaces in disbelief.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"It's been too long since you've gone to see him. Won't you visit his mausoleum?\"<br /><br />JAKE: That's impolite. Wouldn't you say that's in poor taste? Can't he rest in peace?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number five: an Owen named Clive! He's got a palace in the English hills, and you can visit and stay for the thrills! Clive Owen would love to have ya.\"<br /><br />JAKE: No he wouldn't! So far, three of your ideas have been about visiting celebrities who definitely don't want you there. One of whom is dead.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number four: Lock your door! This staycation is for you and a PlayStation 2. Lock yourself in your room all summer and close the blinds. That's the best way I know how to unwinds! And if it's a weekday... go to work!\"<br /><br />JAKE: You know, that's almost as sad as the Brad Renfro one. How are these vacation ideas? Barely any of them have involved a destination! Most of them have involved not traveling!<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three: How 'bout some tea? It's a good liquid that's nice for your soul. Have it in a cup, a mug, or a... bowl...\" What?<br /><br />JAKE: You crossed lists? With another scroll?<br /><br />AMIR: Shit. Yeah, I think I musta got... [sighs] I-- I need to get my shit together! [chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: You need to stop writing all these scrolls.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number two: This jelly won't do... we need a jam or a paste of some sort; 'almond butter is nice' is my... usual retort...\" I'm sorry.<br /><br />JAKE: What other scroll could this possibly even be from?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm fucking unraveling here! Wheels are coming off as I stumble across the finish line!<br /><br />JAKE: Just to be clear: don't think you had a good scroll up until this point.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I had a perfect game going!<br /><br />JAKE: Absolutely not.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! Okay, here we go. \"Number one: Palm Springs. A desert getaway with your best friend.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Not going with you.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Well I know it might be a long snot...\"<br /><br />[Amir puts a finger over one of his nostrils, sharply exhales, and shoots an enormous amount of snot across the desk and onto Jake's shirt.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh! I'm gonna throw up!<br /><br />AMIR: \"...but I figure it's worth a shot!\"<br /><br />JAKE: I can't believe you just snot rocketed on me.

Will you go away with me?\"<br /><br />JAKE: You know what, dude? Fuck it. Snot rocket for you. Here we go--<br /><br />[Jake tries to blow snot like Amir did, but nothing comes out.

Thanks for including me, guys!<br /><br />[Amir's presence on the couch forces Pat off onto an adjacent chair. Amir puts his arm around Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: We specifically tried not to include you.

Can I change the channel, or do we have to watch this soccer shit?<br /><br />[Jake pushes Amir's hand off of him.]<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] Hi, twat. Yeah, can we get two large pizzas, one medium pie, and, let's say, seven small 'zas?<br /><br />PAUL: Those are all just different words for the same thing.<br /><br />RACHEL: And we already have pizza.<br /><br />AMIR: And chicken wings? Yeah, I love those frickin' things.<br /><br />JAKE: Can you not order in weird rhymes? It's rude.<br /><br />AMIR: Whats?<br /><br />JAKE: ...\"Whats\"?<br /><br />AMIR: Ever notice how we call it \"soccer\", but in the rest of the world it's all like \"Futbol! Futbol! Futbol!\"<br /><br />[Paul smiles.]<br /><br />JAKE: Of course we noticed that.<br /><br />AMIR: Then laugh! It's an observational humor!<br /><br />JAKE: It's not humor. It's just an observation.<br /><br />AMIR: Still! A chuckle would have been decent. Got this fatass to grin about it! [laughs]<br /><br />PAUL: Oh, no. My cousin just sent me a text that made me smile. It wasn't you.<br /><br />AMIR: [still laughing] Count it!<br /><br />AMIR: [on the phone] My credit card number is, um, uh...

They don't affect anyone or anything.<br /><br />PAT: No-- what are your hobbies?<br /><br />AMIR: Well, not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, I'll always pretend like it's buzzing. Make my dumbass mom or my goofy dad walk up to the waitress, time after time, in vain. [chuckles] Then at the end of the bit, I'll throw the beeper away so that my dad ends up owing cash for it.<br /><br />JAKE: Your hobbies are bad.<br /><br />AMIR: No shit, dude.<br /><br />JAKE: You're bad.<br /><br />AMIR: All I'm saying is that real athletes don't wear cleats.

Amir eventually raises his hand.]<br /><br />AMIR: All's I'm saying is for a sport to be exciting, there should be points, you know?

What horoscope things?<br /><br />AMIR: About how, like, if you were born in January, that means you're a Capricorn, and so you're some type of way?<br /><br />JAKE: So not horoscope things, just horoscopes in general.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: You think people are just talking about them lately, or always?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know, I-- it was in the ether, but now it's starting to get to me.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh my God.<br /><br />AMIR: Honestly, I thought a lot of it was legalese Japanese mumbo-jumbo bullshit; Western medicine meets Western Union; urban garbage yoga yuppie mommy-blogger rag-mag e-zine Candyland cookie-cutter sci-fi wi-fi jai alai verbal diarrhea, but honestly, it turns out a lot of it is spiritual fact.<br /><br />JAKE: Got it. Cool.<br /><br />AMIR: When's your birthday? August 5th, 1985?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't pretend like you didn't know.<br /><br />AMIR: 2:15 PM?<br /><br />JAKE: That's exactly it, by the way. Good guess.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay. Cool, so, like, yours is, uh--<br /><br />JAKE: Down to the minute.<br /><br />AMIR: [reading from a newspaper] \"You will confront conflicts this month, but rest assured you can solve them. Maybe not, though.\" ...It's vintage you!<br /><br />JAKE: That's vintage anybody.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding out his hand for emphasis] No! Because the way it works is that you're a Leo, so the stars look like a lion, and it knows what you're gonna-- how you're gonna act.<br /><br />JAKE: Try not to learn new things. [imitating Amir, holding out his hand] The stars look like a lion, and it knows how I'm gonna act?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. They really do. They look like a lion.<br /><br />JAKE: Put your hand down, 'cause you're not teaching me anything, okay? It's like you read the Wikipedia for horoscopes-- I don't even think you got into astrology...<br /><br />[Amir shakes his head.]<br /><br />JAKE: No? I didn't-- didn't think so.<br /><br />AMIR: No way.<br /><br />JAKE: And then you just regurgitate everything like it's your new worldview! Your mind is so impressionable.<br /><br />AMIR: My mind is not impressionable!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it is!<br /><br />AMIR: I guess it is.<br /><br />JAKE: God, that's fast. Even for you, that was fast. You're, like, hypnotized. Like, you'll believe anything anyone says.<br /><br />AMIR: [calmly] I will believe anything anyone says...<br /><br />[Jake pauses.]<br /><br />JAKE: [equally calmly] You're getting sleepy.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm getting... [closing his eyes] sleepy...<br /><br />JAKE: You're getting very sleepy.<br /><br />AMIR: Very sleepy, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't say I was your master.<br /><br />AMIR: Didn't have to.<br /><br />JAKE: Anything I say is your command. Your mind is open to my suggestion.<br /><br />AMIR: I am your mental slave.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Yes.<br /><br />AMIR: And thus, you are my master.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Just don't repeat it, okay?<br /><br />AMIR: Fine, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: ...When I snap my fingers, you will wake up.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: And when you wake up, you will...<br /><br />AMIR: Cluck like a chicken. Something silly. Boy, will my face be red.<br /><br />JAKE: You'll throw yourself out the window.<br /><br />AMIR: Jesus.<br /><br />JAKE: That's right. When I snap my fingers, you will awaken and run out the window.<br /><br />AMIR: My fear is that the window will be closed and I'll break my neck on the glass. Then you'll be left to deal with me as a quadriplegic, Master.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. Open the window...<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: ...then jump.<br /><br />AMIR: No chicken.<br /><br />JAKE: No chicken. Just jumping. Leaping, out of a four-story window, to your death.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Got it.<br /><br />JAKE: Before you go...<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: ...remember to shoot me a text. Something like... \"Hey, there was nothing you could have done to stop me\", et cetera.<br /><br />AMIR: Mm. A suicide note of sorts. Yup.<br /><br />JAKE: A suicide text of sorts. Indeed. So when I snap my fingers--<br /><br />AMIR: Absolving you of guilt.<br /><br />JAKE: Exactly.<br /><br />AMIR: Got it.<br /><br />JAKE: Got it. Okay, so I'm gonna snap my fingers. Wake up, suicide text...<br /><br />AMIR: Chicken.<br /><br />JAKE: Out the window. No chicken.<br /><br />AMIR: No chicken.<br /><br />JAKE: No clucking-- you can do whatever you want on the way down.<br /><br />AMIR: Sure.<br /><br />JAKE: Just be sure to do the... you know, the important bullet points.<br /><br />AMIR: Absolutely. Thank you, Master.<br /><br />[Jake snaps.]<br /><br />AMIR: [waking up] Aaah. Jesus. [laughing in confusion] What happened?<br /><br />JAKE: I don't know, man. Just... whatever. Just chilling.<br /><br />AMIR: [confused, texting Jake] ...I'm texting you....<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, yeah. Go for it.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: [reading, frustrated] Semicolon, dollar sign, \"Jake tried to kill me\", sunglasses emoji, \"I'm not a chicken\".<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up the newspaper] That's right! My horoscope told me to be on the lookout for hypno-killers, and it was right! Sagittarius, motherfucker!<br /><br />JAKE: You're a Capricorn.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] You still tried to kill me! Little fucker!<br /><br />END ",

Your breath smells awful!<br /><br />AMIR: Chill!<br /><br />[Jake and Amir at their desks. Amir is trying to offer Jake a piece of gum while Jake ignores him. Amir waves, getting Jake's attention, and again offers him the gum.]<br /><br />AMIR: Gum?<br /><br />JAKE: I'm OK.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna...have a slice [laughs nervously]...thought I'd offer you one.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm good.<br /><br />AMIR: First you're OK now you're good? [Puts stick of gum half in his mouth so that it's sticking out.] What's wrong with you? You're acting all goofy--[Laughs] I mean are you high at work? I'm not gonna tell anyone, I'm just down to toke! Or at least have a bite of whatever edible you're high!<br /><br />JAKE: I just don't want--<br /><br />AMIR: My gum.<br /><br />JAKE:--to talk to you.<br /><br />AMIR: I know.

[Scoffs.]<br /><br />[Silence]<br /><br />AMIR: [Playing with the piece of gum he hasn't put in his mouth. Squints.] Hmm?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say anything. Do you wish I did? <br /><br />AMIR: Are you sure? It's on the house!<br /><br />JAKE: Did you think I was declining because I thought you were gonna make me pay for it?<br /><br />AMIR: The pack was like two bucks! If you wanna toss me a dollar...sure that'd be fine [Chuckles]. That'd be fair--<br /><br />JAKE: Fair? No it wouldn't. That would mean I get half the pack of gum, and I said no to a piece. <br /><br />AMIR: You said you were OK!? You said you were good--[getting angry] you didn't say jack shit about no. Holy shit; you are high!!<br /><br />JAKE: Relax! Alright? I'll have a piece of gum. <br /><br />AMIR: [Nodding his head] Slice. <br /><br />JAKE: Piece! Never correct me--Just give me the gum!<br /><br />AMIR: [Smugly] Oh. Well. What are you gonna do for me? [Takes out stick of gum. Raises eyebrows suggestively.]<br /><br />JAKE: Never mind.<br /><br />AMIR: Wait! I have something that you want [Holds up piece of gum.]! You gotta pay me back somehow, that's how society works! [Pretends to type on computer] I'm not working here for free! [Chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: You're not working here at all! [Amir is bobbing up and down on his chair and chewing the gum with his mouth open while Jake is talking.] I don't think I've ever seen you do or complete a single task--chew the gum with your mouth closed. Alright? [Amir's movements become more frantic.] You look so unnatural doing it. <br /><br />AMIR: [Still chewing with his mouth open.] It's cool. It's friendly. It's chill--<br /><br />JAKE: Don't bob your head--it's not friendly. What's friendly about it?<br /><br />AMIR: It's like [Amir winks awkwardly. Jake grimaces.]...It's just a nice thing to do! [Laughs weakly.]<br /><br />JAKE: I don't want the gum. I was just gonna take it so you would shut up!<br /><br />AMIR: Shut up! [Amir grimaces.] Really!? [Jake facepalms.] That language?! [Waves pack of gum in the air.] From someone who has something that you want. It's tit for tat, Jakey! When that tit-tat is a Tic Tac or a Kit-Kat, you can't go this that, hit hat! You gotta go mit ma--<br /><br />JAKE: Focus! <br /><br />[Amir doesn't respond or move as he chews his gum loudly, staring at Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: I don't wanna sit next to you anymore. <br /><br />AMIR: [Stops chewing.] What?<br /><br />JAKE: I wanna move desks. <br /><br />[Amir swallows the gum.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake--<br /><br />JAKE: I'm done.<br /><br />AMIR: Gum's gone, man...alright? This is...<br /><br />JAKE: [Shrugging] Doesn't matter that the gum's gone. I'm--<br /><br />AMIR: [Shaking his head, smiling.] It's such a--This is such a small thing in the grand scheme of things. I-i-it's infinitesimal! <br /><br />JAKE: It's small, maybe, in the grand scheme of things but the grand scheme of things is what I'm worried about, OK? It's a lot of little things, like this, adding up. Also...you know, you stabbed me once--<br /><br />AMIR: Once.<br /><br />JAKE: More often than I've stabbed anyone!<br /><br />AMIR: Really?...Shit. I'm sorry!<br /><br />JAKE: That's also the first time you apologized for it which is pretty fucked.<br /><br />AMIR: Just [sighs] look under your desk. <br /><br />[Jake reaches under his desk and pulls out a pack of gum showing it to Amir and smiling slightly.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's my own pack of gum. [Taps pack of gum on desk.]<br /><br />[Amir nods and smiles knowingly.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's a pretty nice gesture. I see where you were going this whole time--<br /><br />AMIR: Now in terms of paying me back are you thinking about cash or favours?<br /><br />JAKE: I thought this was a gift.<br /><br />AMIR: Well I still wanna hang out!!<br /><br />END",

Amir has fashioned a standing desk for himself by putting a small table on top of his regular desk. He also has a chocolate milkshake and a plate of nachos. He looks down at Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing awkwardly] Unhealthy... [pause] ...What?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say anything. You said \"unhealthy\"--<br /><br />AMIR: Unhealthy much!<br /><br />JAKE: You said \"unhealthy\", then I didn't say anything. If you're trying to start a conversation--<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling over Jake] Look at you--<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you do that? <br /><br />AMIR: [pointing at Jake for emphasis] Bad for your back, bad for your spine, bad for your life, bad for your attitude, bad--<br /><br />JAKE: You're eating nachos!<br /><br />[Amir eats another nacho.]<br /><br />JAKE: You're eating nachos right now, and you're drinking a chocolate milkshake.<br /><br />AMIR: [grabbing the milkshake] Yeah, that's 'cause I have a standing desk! Which means I can afford it... [goes to take a sip, then pauses] ...fuckwad! [takes a sip]<br /><br />JAKE: You're a fuckwad. [Amir wiggles his eyebrows] You think standing at your desk burns-- what, that's like fifteen hundred calories! Alright? And-- ...also, you're sitting.<br /><br />AMIR: [now sitting, bouncing up and down] Yeah, but on an exercise ball! Okay? AKA!<br /><br />[Amir begins making rhythmic hand motions. Jake waits for a while for him to keep talking.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...What?<br /><br />JAKE: ...AKA what?<br /><br />AMIR: What are you, waiting for me to talk? [laughs] Alright! Let's talk!<br /><br />JAKE: Waiting for you to finish! AKA means \"also known as\".<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, I didn't know that... wow!<br /><br />JAKE: It's not just a pe-- it's not the end of the sentence!<br /><br />AMIR: I didn't know that! I thought it was like a pu-- yeah, like a...<br /><br />JAKE: A pun?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a play on words!<br /><br />JAKE: We don't have to talk! We don't have to talk at the office. That's not leading a healthy lifestyle. You can't afford to eat that food.<br /><br />AMIR: My legs were tired, fatass! And by the way, this is healthy! Healthier than the standing desk, 'cause I can do crunches while I work! [closes his eyes and begins doing crunches badly]<br /><br />JAKE: Your eyes are shut. So you're not doing anything while you work. You're just doing crunches, and... what terrible form! You're twirling your ass on top of the ball like you're wiping with it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, well they hurt my back pain!<br /><br />JAKE: Redundant.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah! I have sciatica, motherfucker!<br /><br />JAKE: I think sciatica is pain in your leg.<br /><br />AMIR: Yes! Which is why I can't stand. So I sit, which hurts my back. That's why I got the desk! It just hurts, so I'm sitting, AKA!<br /><br />JAKE: ...If you're this sick, if you're this unhealthy, why don't you just do the decent thing, and allow yourself to die?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Jesus!<br /><br />JAKE: That was real.<br /><br />AMIR: That's, like, a lot of times you ask me to die.<br /><br />JAKE: I know, and I mean it every time.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing uncomfortably] It's so... sad.<br /><br />JAKE: Trust me, I know.<br /><br />AMIR: It's sad to me that you want me dead.<br /><br />JAKE: I feel bad as a person that I want so badly for you to be dead and gone, but I--<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah. You're not even hiding it anymore.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I think I'm just gonna be open with it.<br /><br />AMIR: I need to... I need to lay down.<br /><br />[Amir lays down on the floor.]<br /><br />JAKE: Thirty seconds ago, you were boasting about your standing desk, and now you're on the floor.<br /><br />AMIR: [still eating his nachos] It doesn't matter if I'm sitting or lying, okay? As long as my work gets handed in.<br /><br />JAKE: What work are you handing in? You're just shoveling nachos into your face, lying down on the ground, and-- oh my God, you're asleep.<br /><br />[Amir has fallen asleep on the floor.]<br /><br />JAKE: How is that possible? You were just yelling. Now you're asleep.<br /><br />[Amir begins choking on his mouthful of nachos. Jake runs over to help him, and then reconsiders. He watches Amir struggle for air in his sleep, until Amir eventually lies still on the ground.]<br /><br />JAKE: [looking upward, and whispering] Thank you...<br /><br />[Amir suddenly coughs up his nachos all over Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm alive!<br /><br />JAKE: Ass.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing in relief] And it's all thanks to that standing desk.<br /><br />[Jake scowls at Amir.]<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />END",

You know I do have tens of millions of dollars.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay.<br /><br />AMIR: But, here's the trick: you do have to tell people about it.<br /><br />JAKE: How many people?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Seventy.<br /><br />JAKE: No deal.<br /><br />AMIR: Aah, no no no, nineteen.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, now I feel bad.<br /><br />AMIR: Aah-- two!<br /><br />JAKE: I feel bad.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm serious, dude. My credit score is so low, I couldn't get approved for a birthday card. [tugs his collar]<br /><br />JAKE: Stop roasting yourself.<br /><br />AMIR: Phyllis Diller is here...<br /><br />AMIR: So what you're saying is once I have this magic card, I can buy whatever I want, like a vehicle, or a three-bean salad, or a Mr. Skin Pro account?<br /><br />JAKE: It's not a magic card. Yeah, you can buy whatever you want, as long as--<br /><br />AMIR: I know, but I can get, like, a salami sandwich, some Silly Putty, and, let's say, I don't know, a Mr. Skin Pro account?<br /><br />JAKE: Right. As long as you pay the m--<br /><br />AMIR: Can I get a Mr. Skin Pro account with--<br /><br />JAKE: You already have one. Look at this. You've had it for two years, and you owe a lot of money.<br /><br />AMIR: My credit score is so low, Flo Rida wrote a song about it.<br /><br />JAKE: \"Low\"?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Whistle\"! [begins blowing air in Jake's face in an attempt to whistle]<br /><br />JAKE: Your breath is so bad.<br /><br />AMIR: What I'm in dire need of is actually dolphin food. Or dolphin medicine. Or...<br /><br />JAKE: ...Dolphin--<br /><br />AMIR: Caskets, yeah. Exactly right.<br /><br />JAKE: Not what I was gonna say.<br /><br />AMIR: Because you can stuff it into a human casket?<br /><br />JAKE: Of course not.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you can't.<br /><br />AMIR: Call me Han! Because my credit score is...<br /><br />JAKE: So low.<br /><br />AMIR: ...out of this world!<br /><br />JAKE: Bad.<br /><br />[Amir coos like a pigeon. Jake cringes at his breath.]<br /><br />JAKE: Really bad.<br /><br />AMIR: You know, human caskets, not too terrible of an idea.<br /><br />JAKE: Didn't say it.<br /><br />AMIR: If you just wiggle that dorsal fin back and forth like you're peeling off a soda tab, you know, [as he mimes trying to tear off a dorsal fin] A, B, C... and then whatever letter it lands on, that girl has a crush on you?<br /><br />JAKE: What do you mean, \"lands on\"?<br /><br />AMIR: [miming ripping off the fin, making Jake wince] Like if it gets ripped off on S, you're gonna marry a Samantha...!<br /><br />JAKE: You're a monster.<br /><br />AMIR: Now I understand to build my credit score, I need to make my payments in a timely fashion.<br /><br />JAKE: Right, so--<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, and if I don't will they hack my nuts off?<br /><br />[Jake doesn't respond.]<br /><br />AMIR: Then I'm good.<br /><br />JAKE: They're not gonna hack your nuts off--<br /><br />AMIR: Then I'm good.<br /><br />JAKE: --but you'll go into debt and they'll take away your possessions--<br /><br />AMIR: But my nuts? Are they gonna take away my most prized possession? My family jewels? ...I'm okay then.<br /><br />AMIR: Mirror, mirror, on the wa-- [hits a key] \"Denied\". How is that normal?<br /><br />JAKE: It's very normal. It's very normal because under \"Debt\" you wrote \"150K dolphin fee\", under \"Address\" you wrote \"Fuck off NSA\", and under \"Annual Income\"-- I don't even know how you did this, 'cause it's a drop-down menu-- but you wrote \"Flappy the dolphin is my guarantor; give me the gold card\".<br /><br />AMIR: [crying] I wanted the points! I wanted the points, I needed the miles, and I could have really used a trip. [closes his laptop] Least I got my nuts.<br /><br />[Amir looks down. With a horrified look, he feels his lap.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Dude!<br /><br />END",

Amir does not have a computer. He tugs at his hoodie and wiggles his eyebrows at Jake.]<br /><br />JAKE: No computer at all today, huh?<br /><br />[Amir shakes his head.]<br /><br />JAKE: Why even come in?<br /><br />AMIR: I can work from my phone. [feels for a phone in his pocket, to no avail] ...Shit.<br /><br />JAKE: Nice.<br /><br />[A woman comes over briefly to hand Amir a manila envelope. Amir notices and begins laughing giddily.]<br /><br />AMIR: [opening the envelope] They're here, they're here! Help me choose a headshot!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't act giddy like I'm gonna be excited about helping you choose a headshot.<br /><br />AMIR: I just want your opinion!<br /><br />JAKE: My opinion is you suck.<br /><br />AMIR: About the headshots, idiot! [laughing] You should have let me finish! Now you look like a fool!<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you need headshots? You have a job. You have a salary. Health insurance.<br /><br />AMIR: I want to be a famous! Ass! A star is born? Nah... a star is corn!<br /><br />[Amir holds up a picture of himself dressed as an ear of corn with big cartoon gloves.]<br /><br />JAKE: What a dumb headshot, buddy.<br /><br />AMIR: Please don't call these dumb. Okay? I spent, like, a bad amount of money on these.<br /><br />JAKE: Any amount of money you spent on those would be a bad amount of money, considering you're not an actor and you don't need them.<br /><br />AMIR: I have an audition today!<br /><br />[Jake raises his eyebrows. Amir grins silently at him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Wow! Suddenly, Jake's-- actually, this is perfect! [handing a fork and a knife to Jake] I'll give you a fork and a knife so you can eat your words. And, in addition to those--<br /><br />JAKE: [taking the fork and knife] God, these are nice.<br /><br />AMIR: --I have a napkin... where the French is it? I don't want you to spill the words--<br /><br />JAKE: Did you bring this cutlery to work just to make me do this?<br /><br />AMIR: Where the fff-- is it, dude?<br /><br />JAKE: [putting down the fork and knife] It doesn't matter where the napkin is, okay? What's the role?<br /><br />AMIR: The role is of a paralegal, in the film \"Steinberg and Ginsberg\".<br /><br />JAKE: Are you sure you don't mean firm Steinberg and Ginsberg? And the role is just an office job that you're not qualified for?<br /><br />AMIR: Every interview in this town is an audition. In this town.<br /><br />JAKE: Nice, dude. Give it to me.<br /><br />[Amir hands Jake the headshots. On top is one of Amir shirtless, wearing jeans low enough on his hips that his pubic hair is visible, albeit censored.]<br /><br />JAKE: Yikes. Way too revealing. Right? I mean, at least you had the decency to blur your pubes.<br /><br />AMIR: [sadly] No, they're just blurry.<br /><br />JAKE: You grow blurry pubic hair?<br /><br />AMIR: I think so, yeah. They're mosaic.<br /><br />JAKE: [holding up a picture of Amir with Terry Richardson] Sorry, did Terry Richardson take these?<br /><br />AMIR: Actually, they were taken by a Brazilian photographer. [grabbing the headshots back] Nunya? Ever heard of him?<br /><br />JAKE: Nunya Business?<br /><br />AMIR: No, Nunya Luiz Ricardio. He's actually pretty famous in Rio.<br /><br />JAKE: Do something else with your life.<br /><br />[Amir is suddenly holding a colorful and simplistic painting with two stick figures.]<br /><br />AMIR: Been painting recently! Nothing too crazy, just some abstract pieces. Trying to open up my own gallery.<br /><br />JAKE: That's crazy! Of course that's crazy. Trying to open up your own gallery when you have a job, and... you're not very good at painting!<br /><br />AMIR: Subjective.<br /><br />JAKE: You're so fast at being dumb. Why don't you just try to harness that power for good, instead of... stupidity?<br /><br />AMIR: [holding a plate of burnt cookies] Been baking recently!<br /><br />JAKE: Quick. Burned.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, nothing too crazy. Just, uh, applying for grants to open up my own patisserie/gallery.<br /><br />JAKE: Bad business idea. Bad you. Just stop acting, stop painting, stop baking. It's a waste of time, money, and I think effort, though it seems like you don't try very hard at anything.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up a napkin folded into an origami swan] Found your napkin!<br /><br />JAKE: That one's pretty good.<br /><br />AMIR: Nothing too crazy, just some, uh... oregano.<br /><br />JAKE: Origami.<br /><br />AMIR: Roach!<br /><br />JAKE: It's a swan.<br /><br />AMIR: Ass!<br /><br />END",

Jake here. Look, I've been seeing this little thing poppin' up around on Facebook, just... just here and there, but you know me. I like to get into trends early. So here I--<br /><br />AMIR: [leaning in from off-screen] I did it a few weeks ago!<br /><br />JAKE: Did I invite you in here to brag, Blumenfeld? I don't like to share the limelight, so why don't you tread light. Fucker.<br /><br />AMIR: You invited me in here 'cause you said nobody else would hold your bucket for you.<br /><br />JAKE: [trying to drown out Amir] Shhhhhh. Just relax about why I invited you in here. [to the camera] Look, been seein' this Cup of Water Challenge thing on Facebook, but... you know, I'mma do it J-Witz style, do you two better. First of all: I say fuck it, I'm gonna go a whole bucket. And, uh, another thing, Regis: I put a freakin' ice cube in here. And that is my final answer.<br /><br />AMIR: Aren't most people doing it with a...with a bucket and--<br /><br />JAKE: [singing] And IIIIII-ee-III will always ice cube!

I'm gonna freeze myself with this here bucket, like, uh, Jack Nicholson at the end of the Shining. Hey, you think he ever met Steve Urkel? From Family Matters? [doing a Jack Nicholson impression] \"Uhh, did I do that?\" [looking at Amir for a reaction]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Maybe, yeah. I--<br /><br />JAKE: Alright. Fuck you. [to the camera] Okay. I'm not gonna do this before challenging a couple of my close personal friends to, uh, take the Jake challenge, that is, not a cup, but the fuck-it bucket, and, uh, not just one, but a big-ass cube o' ice! [laughs]<br /><br />AMIR: S-- ...so yes. Just one.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. Bradley Cooper, from Limitless. Tarvis Baker, from Blink-182 [pronounced \"eighteen-two\"]. And, and another guy: Vanilla Bean Ice himself! Stop-- Hammer time! [humming] Dahh-nah-nah-nah... nah-nah, can't touch this.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright. Here we go. Ready.<br /><br />JAKE: Hey, hey, hold on, before you do it, [to the camera] as I understand it, I was challenged to donate a hundred dollars to ALS research, unless I dump this, this bucket of water on my head, in which case... ALS research, y'all owe me a hundred bucks.<br /><br />AMIR: I don't know if it's that-- like, that--<br /><br />JAKE: Just-- ...I didn't invite you here to do an interview, did I? Let's do this! Come on!<br /><br />JAKE/AMIR: Three, two one!<br /><br />[Amir dumps the bucket over Jake's head. Barely a small cup's worth of water comes out.]<br /><br />JAKE: [screaming] Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho, that was legit! Less than room temp, dude! Look! Major shrinkage.<br /><br />[Jake shows Amir his penis below-screen, and Amir, who was initially hopping up and down with adrenaline, stops.]<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa. The water wasn't that cold.<br /><br />JAKE: I have a tiny dick.<br /><br />AMIR: [to the camera] To actually help out, go to ALSA.org!<br /><br />[\"ALSA.org\" appears on screen.

Bad teeth!<br /><br />AMIR: Hope you like to barbecue!<br /><br />JAKE: Why?<br /><br />AMIR: 'Cause homeboy's got a grill!<br /><br />JAKE: Why did you do that to your face?

I asked how you made it. You don't do anything.<br /><br />AMIR: My dad gives me bank. Quite bank, actually.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, then you know what? You don't make anything. You get pathetic handouts from your old man, and it's not cool to flaunt that with exorbitantly expensive jewelry for your teeth.<br /><br />AMIR: I got this grill off Sale!<br /><br />JAKE: On sale, and still, it's probably pretty expensive.<br /><br />AMIR: No, my cousin Leron. He has a friend named Sale.<br /><br />JAKE: He's got a friend named Sale?<br /><br />AMIR: Well, had a friend named Sal.<br /><br />JAKE: ...Sale, or Sal?<br /><br />AMIR: Sale. Sale.<br /><br />JAKE: Which one?<br /><br />AMIR: Sale!<br /><br />JAKE: Sale, or Sal?<br /><br />AMIR: Sam!<br /><br />JAKE: Which one is it? Sale, Sal, or Sam?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Sale.<br /><br />JAKE: Doesn't matter. Okay, you got the grill off him?<br /><br />AMIR: Off her. And no, not her grill, her teeth. Okay? When she passed, me and Leron had the dim idea  to gank the dentures off her still-breathing body!<br /><br />JAKE: Still breathing. So she hadn't passed.<br /><br />AMIR: We're all at the vet trying to huff some of that laughy gassy, when we realized: uh-oh! Some of it's euthanasia! So me and Leron hightail it the fuck out of there, but, uh... Sale wasn't too lucky. She couldn't flap her wings fast enough.<br /><br />JAKE: Flap her wings?<br /><br />AMIR: Did I mention Sale was a goose?<br /><br />JAKE: ...No! No, of course not, 'cause then all my questions would have been about that! Why did the goose have teeth?<br /><br />AMIR: I guess you can say she's trans-gandered!<br /><br />JAKE: Decent pun, doesn't explain the teeth, and your gums are bleeding.<br /><br />AMIR: [with his hand on his mouth] Sure, small price to pay.<br /><br />JAKE: Kind of a lot of blood, and it's a pretty big price to pay, man! You don't have teeth. You and your cousin are friends with a goose.<br /><br />AMIR: Were!<br /><br />JAKE: Still! A goose!<br /><br />AMIR: No, I mean me and Leron aren't cousins anymore! He frickin' divorced me!<br /><br />JAKE: Please, just one insane thing at a time. Why did the goose have teeth?<br /><br />AMIR; Dentures.<br /><br />JAKE: Which you stole.<br /><br />AMIR: How was your weekend? ...Always talkin' about my shit. How was your Friday? What'd you do Saturday morning?<br /><br />JAKE: Where are your real teeth?<br /><br />AMIR: I traded them to Leron for a BeDazzler so that I can jewel-encrust Sale's dentures so that I can flaunt my father's wealth! What don't you get?<br /><br />JAKE: Why do you hate yourself?<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE You're on this twisted quest to change your body, mind, and spirit. You're constantly adopting new hobbies. [Amir begins dancing in his seat.] You've had countless plastic surgeries-- stop dancing! [Amir stops.] None of it is ever to any avail. At the end of the day, you're still you... and you suck.<br /><br />[Amir makes a mock-hurt expression.]<br /><br />JAKE: Oh, I know that did hurt.<br /><br />[Amir dabs his forehead, and salutes Jake sarcastically. Jake salutes him back. Amir pauses, and then begins crying.]<br /><br />JAKE: There it is. [claps] Finally. That's what I was hoping for. That's the way you should always be.<br /><br />AMIR: Want to know the gayest part?<br /><br />JAKE: Don't use that word like that.<br /><br />AMIR: I truly believe that the world revolves around me.

[picks up a marble and a tennis ball, and rolls the tennis ball around the marble]<br /><br />JAKE: Quick to get those.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, this is how I feel. Like I am at the center of it. Like I'm the Sun. [chuckles] I mean, how dumb is that?<br /><br />JAKE: It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Nothing revolves around you. You absolutely don't matter, 'cause you're a goose murderer. You're a teeth thief.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well at least I got a grill I can count on! [holds up a sausage] Hope you like sausage!<br /><br />JAKE: Raw meat. In your mouth.<br /><br />[Amir puts the sausage to its mouth, and it begins smoking and sizzling.]<br /><br />JAKE: Holy shit, how is it sizzling?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm the Sun!

That's the most boring idea in the world. You'll just have a package with the name Vance on it.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, but then after a while, the mailman will start to call you Vance! He'll be like, \"Hey Vance, how's it going?\" You'll be like, \"Oh, it's pretty good, but actually boom! Gotcha!

Yeah, I know.<br /><br />AMIR: A gala. Yeah, exactly right, a gala.<br /><br />JAKE: Tell you what, buddy. Why don't you just leave them in your online basket, you don't have to check out right now--<br /><br />AMIR: No way.<br /><br />JAKE: --but if you get invited to a white tie event--<br /><br />AMIR: No, dude! That's--<br /><br />JAKE: --or a gala... I'm not saying-- look--<br /><br />AMIR: It's way too risky!<br /><br />JAKE: You can order them in time!<br /><br />AMIR: Bought 'em.

Amir comes in with flowers.]<br /><br />AMIR: [first singing to the tune of \"Here Comes the Bride\", then just yelling] Here comes the dweeb... Here comes the dweeb! [speaking to Jake] Shittiest Weekend of the Ever Award goes to, dumroll please... Amir Hurwitz! \"You like me! You really like me!\" Friday night, I crash a feminist meeting, and told each and every one of them the God's honest truth: that they were all on the rag! Their aunt Flo didn't just come into town to visit. She moved in, and they were becoming scissor sisters. I wish one thing led to another, because what happened next was all at once. They tied my wrists to my face, shoved a tampon in my asshole, and kicked me out into the street! Keep in mind, this was 7:45 PM, so it's still bright out and I'm missing Jeopardy! I will take \"Things You Don't Want Your Parents to See after Leaving a Restaurant for Their Forty-Second Anniversary\" for, let's say, two hundred, Alex. [humming the Jeopardy theme] Doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo doo doo doo doo, ba-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo doo doooo... doo, doo-doo doo doo-- [raspberry] --doo-- [raspberry] --doo. Bom, bom. What is their thirty-one-year-old son scooting across the sidewalk like a baby in a diaper, trying to grind the tampon out of his bleeding asshole while he howls at the moon like a wolf! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! And what did you wager, Alex? Zero dollars? That's... that's funny, 'cause that's how much my life was worth to the police officer who, rather than unbind me, took out his Motorola Krzr and added me to his SnapStory. What? Just as I start to think outside the bun, you know, convincing myself that at the very least this will be a fun little anecdote to tell at my bachelor party-- if I don't decide to go stag to my own wedding-- four of these femmes fatales emerge from the shadows, [pointing to his body] and start assaulting my face, [pointing to his neck] my body, [pointing to his face] and my neck. All of them had hair of gold, [singing the \"Brady Bunch\" theme] like their mother... the youngest one threw squirrels! One landed in my mouth, like a furry ball gag. Finally, out of fear, loathing, or Las Vegas, I j-- [chuckles] I just start spray-shitting everywhere. Yeah, it's like someone's dumping bucket after bucket of chocolate pudding on a rotating helicopter blade. I am defecating hither and thither, still howling, still at the moon, this time blue corn. With the tampon finally out, hands still tied to my face, [Ace Ventura impression] I finally have the wherewithalrighty then! to let out on more zinger. One more joke, this one luckily not at their expense. It's-- it's pretty broad, actually. [taking off his glasses] It goes a little something like this: A woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, \"Hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen.\" The woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, \"That bus driver just insulted me.\" I said, \"Lady, you don't have to take that from him. You go up there and tell him off. Here, I'll hold your monkey.\"<br /><br />[Jake chuckles.]<br /><br />AMIR: Seeing you chuckle at that joke made the entire weekend worthwhile.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh-- no. Paul's cousin texted me something funny.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah? Well my asshole needs stitches! So start laughin', buster!<br /><br />END",

Jake cringes.]<br /><br />JAKE: Did that hurt?<br /><br />AMIR: That's actually a polished final.

Don't write music.<br /><br />AMIR: Joke's on you, 'cause music's not about a single note. It's about a harmony. [laughs] Not surprised you didn't know that, though, 'cause you don't know shit about folk, or folk about shit!<br /><br />JAKE: You have a job here. I don't know why, but you do, so why don't you focus on being good at that. For instance, you didn't even bring a computer charger today. I guess you just figured two hours of work and then you'd be done. And if you don't want to get good at your job, which is... I guess bad, but, fine-- focus on things that would make you a better human being, like hygiene. Brush your teeth. Wipe your ass.<br /><br />AMIR: That's funny, I don't remember that part of the song! How about giving me notes about melody, about tune, about how it sounded?<br /><br />JAKE: Okay.

Okay?<br /><br />AMIR: You're a dickling!<br /><br />JAKE: The inkling that you have, to not do something because you know I'll think it's dumb? That's the first step into, I guess, adolescence.

[chuckles]<br /><br />JAKE: [feeling Amir's forehead] Yeah, your forehead is freezing. It's like a chilled glassy mug. How do you do that?<br /><br />AMIR: Legally, I'm dead.<br /><br />JAKE: I wish, man.<br /><br />AMIR: Mean.<br /><br />[Amir is dressed in a Ghostbusters costume.]<br /><br />AMIR: I ain't afraid of no ghost!<br /><br />JAKE: You absolutely are afraid of ghosts. You called me last night in tears because you were afraid a boogeyman was outside your window, trying to scare you.<br /><br />AMIR: He was.<br /><br />JAKE: You said he was staring at you from across the street, threatening you with cue cards, 'cause he didn't know how to speak?<br /><br />AMIR: That's right.<br /><br />[Amir is wearing a Maleficent gown costume.]<br /><br />AMIR: Who's gonna refuse to give me candy?<br /><br />JAKE: You go trick-or-treating? I thought this was for a costume party.<br /><br />AMIR: What's a costume part?<br /><br />[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume, and Jake is continuing the story.]<br /><br />JAKE: The boogeyman's cue card said \"I can see you, you spendthrift, you Jew spendthrift. Now come down here and give me cash or I'll boogie you.\"<br /><br />AMIR: That's correct.<br /><br />JAKE: You also mentioned the other side of his sign said \"Why lie? I need pot\", so I think you might have just gotten swindled by a homeless man.<br /><br />AMIR: Perhaps, maybe. Mayhaps, probably.<br /><br />JAKE: Probably.<br /><br />[Amir is dressed in a German costume with lederhosen. The liquid in his beer stein is a shade of yellow completely unlike beer.]<br /><br />AMIR: [in a German accent] You Americans have Halloween, we call it Oktoberfest. Prost!<br /><br />JAKE: Did you piss in that?<br /><br />AMIR: Ja, ja, I had to make it a bit yellow. [dips his finger in and sniffs it]<br /><br />[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume. Jake continues.]<br /><br />JAKE: When you finally approached the boogeyman with twenty-five hundred dollars in cash, he said \"This  isn't enough. Get ready, I'm gonna boogie you.\" [Amir flinches.] So you ran away to the nearest ATM, and took out even more money.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, the boogeyman's appetite for cash was insatiable, to be sure. But, I stood up for myself. I refused to be boogied.<br /><br />JAKE: [waving his hands at Amir] Boogie-boogie-boogie-boogie!<br /><br />AMIR: [raising his hands in self-defense and throwing cash at Jake] Aaah! Take my cash!<br /><br />[Amir is dressed as Leonidas.]<br /><br />JAKE: Dumb costume.<br /><br />AMIR: [scoffs] Madness?<br /><br />JAKE: I didn't say \"madness\".<br /><br />AMIR: [standing up, preparing to kick Jake] This is Sparta!<br /><br />[Amir is dressed as a prisoner. He seems to have lost all energy.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake, I'm exhausted... I'm tired of this.<br /><br />JAKE: Me too.<br /><br />AMIR: It's year in, year out, and it wears on you.<br /><br />JAKE: It really does, every day.<br /><br />AMIR: It's fatigue.<br /><br />JAKE: It is.<br /><br />AMIR: That's what it is. I feel... drained.<br /><br />[Amir is in the Leonidas costume, and Jake is reeling from a kick in the chest.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohhh, you can't just go around kicking people in the chest, man! God, that's a dated costume!<br /><br />AMIR: Dated?<br /><br />[Amir stands up again.]<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, stop. Hey.<br /><br />AMIR: [preparing to kick Jake again] This is Sparta!<br /><br />JAKE: Don't, don't--<br /><br />[Amir, in the prisoner costume, continues his lament.]<br /><br />AMIR: Look at me.<br /><br />JAKE: I know. I'm telling you, this is self-reflection right now. It really feels like it's... it feels healthy--<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly energetic again] I'm doing a character! You idiot! [laughs] Gay prisoner!<br /><br />[Amir is wearing an inflatable military costume.]<br /><br />AMIR: Sergeant [bleep] reporting for duty, sir, in the Puffy Army.<br /><br />JAKE: How is this even a costume? And can you please not say [bleep] in the office?<br /><br />AMIR: I don't have to listen to you, [bleep]. I report to Colonel [bleep]. In the Puffy Army...

He and his date are sitting in uncomfortable silence. She brushes her hair away from her eyes, and in response, Amir makes a face as if he's straining to hear something she said.]<br /><br />AMIR: [almost inaudibly] Hm?<br /><br />[Amir's date just shakes her head. They sit in silence for a while longer, and then she yawns.]<br /><br />AMIR: And I win! You spoke first, and thus I have the upper hand now.<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: I didn't say anything.<br /><br />AMIR: Power play.

What's your poison?<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: \"Twinge\"?<br /><br />AMIR: I have not heard of that one. Is that a digestif?<br /><br />AMIR'S DATE: You said Twinge. I don't know what that is.<br /><br />AMIR: [to the server] Let's get my date a wine, and I think I will have... twinge.<br /><br />[The server pours Amir's date a glass of wine. As he stops pouring, Amir tips his hand back the way it was, filling the glass to the very top. Unable to pick it up without spilling it, Amir's date leans in to sip from it.]<br /><br />AMIR: So here's what I'm gonna offer you: [holding up a wad of bills] this is five hundred dollars in cash, and it's yours if you leave right now.<br /><br />[She grabs the cash and begins counting.]<br /><br />AMIR: Just know that if you do take the money and run, that's it. You can't come back. No more second date. Sort of a coy little way to figure out if my dates are in it for the long Paul!

Amir walks home, twitching with frustration. For lack of any emotional outlet, Amir lunges at a homeless man to try and make him flinch. The man lunges back, growling. Amir screams and runs away.]<br /><br />[Amir enters his dark apartment and locks the door. He kicks one shoe off and tosses it into the corner, then flops down on his bed. He kicks off his other shoe, and it nearly hits him in the face. By his bedside table, we see that Amir has several pictures of Jake.]<br /><br />[Amir unbuckles his belt and puts his hand in his pants. He masturbates while staring listlessly at the ceiling of his apartment.]<br /><br />AMIR: [orgasming] Oooo!<br /><br />[Amir opens a packet of barbecue sauce and puts it on some chicken nuggets for himself.]<br /><br />[Amir stares into the mirror, holding a toothbrush with toothpaste on it, and contemplates brushing his teeth. He shakes his head, and puts the toothbrush back down, throwing the toothpaste tube onto the sink counter with it.]<br /><br />[Amir lies in bed, still numb. A framed picture of him and Jake sits in the background on his bedside table. Amir quietly begins crying.]<br /><br />[Amir comes in to the office the next day, and sits down in the chair in solemn silence. Jake stares at him, waiting for something.]<br /><br />AMIR: [suddenly as energetic as ever] Got laid last night! [laughs]<br /><br />END",

Adolf Hitler killed himself, Mickey, and history remembers him as a coward, Mickey!<br /><br />JAKE: Excuse you!<br /><br />AMIR: You haven't lost anything until you sell, Mickey, and I, as your broker, am not gonna let you do that, Mickey!

      "script": "INTRO<br /><br />AMIR: Hello, 'tis the season to watch Jake and Amir! [in a lower register, as Jake] Nice. [singsong] Thank you!<br /><br />[Amir is at his desk, and has Jake on video chat on his computer.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...So...?<br /><br />JAKE: You called me. It's not my job to start a conversation.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, my Thanksgiving? Of course! I'll tell you everything. [chuckles] I was excited to see my loved ones and enjoy a festive meal. Unfortunately, nothing went according to flan! [holds up flan on a plate, laughs at his own joke, and then drops it on his desk] Anyway, listen to this boar shit! I get home Thanksgiving Eve Eve, and I don't know if it's the excitement or the fact that I haven't showered in a couple of... evers, but I develop a zit the size of a gumball on my forehead! I think it's inconvenient, sure, but when I woke up to my dad trying to lance and drain the bitch with a toothbrush he sharpened like a shiv, I'm equal parts appalled and dumb! The vain diva! He said my blemish would ruin everyone's appetite and holiday. So I says to him, I says, straight up, \"Look, I don't have to have dinner with you guys. Frankly, I don't want to have dinner with you guys. But I gotta eat something, or I'm gonna be hangry.\" That's hungry and angry. So he sits silently for a spell, right, and I see something wash over him, this quiet serenity, and I realize this dingbat's gonna lock me in the room! That's the split-second we both charge for the door, and maybe I knock him off course, or maybe he frickin' slipped on the oil dripping from the golf-ball-sized zit, but the roach barrels headlong into the door jamb, and he's out cold. I'm talking frigid, frigid cold. His body is ice, his pulse is... is not. Keep in mind, my old man's forty-two, so at this point, him being dead is no bueno. No bueno at all. So I, I get down on my knees and I pray that the CPR that I saw on an episode of House M.D. on somebody else's TV on an airplane five years ago fucking registered with me! That's right, I'm pumping his chest, leaning in, giving him deep mouth-to-mouth, tongue and all, and having never performed or understood the maneuver, going on just what friggin' Hugh Laurie did on the show, and my daddy's not having any of it. He starts kicking and screaming, and I shout \"Hold still or you're a dead! You're an absolute dead!\" and he-- of course, he takes that the wrong way, I mean look at me! [breaks down into cackling] He reaches down into his pocket, all of a sudden, Papa's [suddenly singing] all about that Mace, 'bout that Mace, no bubble. As in he burst my bubble, when he realized I wasn't the George-Clooney-shaped hero that he hoped I was when he P-sprayed me in the face! The noxious liquid, of absolute course, does nothing to help the zit situation, or zituation for short, and the thing swells up to the size of a tennis ball, throbbing, pulsating, and yes, eventually speaking. Unintelligent squeaks at first, but gaining intelligence by the nanosecond, a full-on sentient staph infection, methinks! My dad gets one look at this horror show, and, and-- and of course he dives out of the window, presumably to his death, but probably not, because my, my room's in the basement. I look in the mirror, and the zit, speaking in tongues at this point, though I understand, demands that I feed it. To a regular human, it's: [makes grotesque noises from his throat] --to me, it's: \"Feed me, feed me, feed me!\" [laughs] So I march downstairs on the pimple's order and begin using the turkey syringe thing, the, uh... the, the, you know, the little ear-bulb thing, the, uh, the... [as if Jake had said something] ...right, the baster. And I'm squeezin' and suckin', feeding and pouring the gravy on the zit, feeding the zit gravy, like it's the opposite of volca-- of a volcano, and it grows, both in size and anger. Finally, the bitch is so big, I'm beginning to think I'm a growth on it, and not the other way around! I mean, at this point, it's borderline comical! So naturally, I throw up my hands and I laugh. Which is right when my dad comes in and sees this-- I mean, I-- how can you describe this as, as anything else but a burlesque show? It really is a burlesque show! And he starts chuckling to himself, and I'll share credit with the evil whitehead, but I got to admit, I'm feeling not bad, because this is the first time, probably ever, that I've seen my dad smile. We go to high five, he misses, probably on purpose, and boom! He hits my zit/boil/Lord and Savior, and boom goes the dynamite. The noise is deafening. And what an explosion! Oh, the humanity! I mean, the entire room is covered in pus and gravy. It looks like... it looks like the inside of an unnatural cave, just stalactites and stalagmites of, of, of, of, of, of this, this, this, this, this, this mucus. This, this pussy, mucusy gravy. So I look-- I look at my old man, this, this forty-two-year-old raisin of a prune at this point, and I go, \"So, uh... who wants pizza?\" [laughing] He starts laughing so hard... he faints, and then my mom is also passing out, because of the, uh... the pus everywhere is steamy hot, so she's sort of suffocating on the moisture, and she faints too, and then just before I pass out, I have this thought, this, this fleeting thought, I'm like, uh... \"How the hell did I turn out so normal?\" [pauses, sighs, then waves his hand at the screen] Y'ello? Can you hear me?<br /><br />[Throughout Amir's entire story, Jake has been ignoring him, occupying himself instead by texting, peeling a sticker off of a thermos, and even leaving to get chips at one point. Until the present moment, Amir has been too immersed in his own story to notice.]<br /><br />JAKE: Yo! Hey, um, sorry. I muted you, in case you told a story that made me sad.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh! No wonder you didn't... [holding up the flan] you didn't laugh at the flan joke.<br /><br />JAKE: I heard the flan joke. That was when I muted you. It was a bad joke.<br /><br />AMIR: No, you... you, uh... you liked it. [laughs, pauses] You liked it.<br /><br />END",

Amir is in a hazmat suit, with his gas mask pulled up above his face. He's wearing latex gloves, which he did not put on carefully enough to get his fingers in properly.]<br /><br />AMIR: [mouthing] Bad idea...<br /><br />[Jake doesn't react. Amir cups his hands around his mouth and repeats himself at full volume.]<br /><br />AMIR: Bad idea!<br /><br />JAKE: You knew I wasn't gonna take the bait, so you yelled it at me, huh? What's a bad idea? You wearing that to work?<br /><br />AMIR: No, you knowingly getting Ebola, to the office.<br /><br />JAKE: You're so behind on everything! No one's talking about Ebola anymore.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm still fearful.<br /><br />JAKE: Of course you are.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm paranoid!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, you're paranoid of what? Ebola in Los Angeles? You're not at risk here, in this office.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up his hands, making a buzzer sound] Daaanhh! Wrong, okay? [gesturing with his fists, while the gloves' fingers flap everywhere] Ebola is an epidemic, which means you're at risk everywhere! Okay? Last time I checked, you weren't Superman! [laughing] Though you're pretty frickin' close...<br /><br />JAKE: What the hell is the matter with your hands?<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: They look disfigured.<br /><br />AMIR: They're not.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to put on gloves?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, ya... [tries to demonstrate putting on gloves] ...squeeze 'em up.<br /><br />JAKE: Forget it. Can you type in that?<br /><br />AMIR: No. Not really, no. At all.<br /><br />JAKE: So why did you open your computer? What work are you doing right now?<br /><br />AMIR: Is it important for me to do work, or is it important for me to be alive? I think it's... I think alive is actually pretty crucial.<br /><br />JAKE: You know, you're at work. You're at your job, so it's pretty crucial for you to be doing your work.<br /><br />AMIR: Question, everyone: Who thinks it's important for me to be alive? [chuckles]<br /><br />[Nobody reacts.]<br /><br />AMIR: Obviously they're not paying attention. Everyone's always... y-you go out to dinner, and everyone's like: [pretending to text] \"Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah.\" No one's ever, like, listening--<br /><br />JAKE: Who here thinks Amir should die?<br /><br />[Many people raise their hand.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ohh! That smarts!<br /><br />JAKE: What makes you think you, of all people, are at risk for Ebola?<br /><br />AMIR: Glad you asked! Leron teased the nurse returning from Liberia to the point where she actually hurled her own feces at him! [laughs] Later on, Leron and I French kissed in front of a security camera as a goof, and I fear some of the original Ebola-infected feces went from his throat into mine.<br /><br />JAKE: If that's all true, then you deserve to have Ebola.<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse...?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Never say that again.<br /><br />AMIR: How do you figure, is all?<br /><br />JAKE: You're teasing a nurse--<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: --who's coming back from Liberia, she went there to help--<br /><br />AMIR: No, no, no, no, no! Listen to the case, dude! Leron was teasing a nurse--<br /><br />JAKE: Leron teased the nurse.<br /><br />AMIR: Leron teased the nurse.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine. You Frenched him.<br /><br />AMIR: I Frenched-- yeah. I French kissed my cousin Leron.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay-- after he had shit in his mouth, and he didn't wash it out!<br /><br />AMIR: As a goof. As a goof, I French kissed--<br /><br />JAKE: As a goof-- it doesn't matter! You're su-- you're-- it's implicit support, is what it is, of his bad actions--<br /><br />AMIR: I'm tongue-kissing him. Okay? I'm tongue-kissing him--<br /><br />JAKE: I caught that part! I--<br /><br />AMIR: --and then I'm afraid that some of the shit in his mouth went into my tongue.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you think I don't understand what happened? I'm saying that those--<br /><br />AMIR: You're saying I teased the nurse. Like I'm a nurse-teaser.<br /><br />JAKE: I got one thing wrong. I got the Frenching right, though.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I--<br /><br />JAKE: Because you French kissed your cousin--<br /><br />AMIR: As a goof--<br /><br />JAKE: --As a goof--<br /><br />JAKE/AMIR: [simultaneously] --on camera.<br /><br />JAKE: Die, then.<br /><br />[Amir vomits.]<br /><br />AMIR: Don't say shit like that, or I'll quarantine your ass!<br /><br />END",

Amir has headphones on. He gasps and grabs his chest, and then turns his attention to Jake and takes off his headphones.]<br /><br />AMIR: I am absolutely obsessed with the new Serial podcast!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, man. I like it a l--<br /><br />[Amir aggressively shushes Jake. As Amir talks, Jake mouths \"Are you kidding me?\"]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm like, every time a new episode comes out, I, I'm just like-- [makes excited eating motions, laughs]<br /><br />JAKE: What are you doing? I was willing to have a conversation with you, and you're steamrolling it. You just have an agenda, and you won't interact with me.<br /><br />AMIR: [talking over Jake] I love it so much! I don't know, I can't explain it! I'm on the edge of my seat. I'm not even halfway done with the second episode, and I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I can't get enough! I literally started, like, three weeks ago.<br /><br />JAKE: So you're not obsessed at all! You barely listen to it. You listened to one and a half episodes?<br /><br />AMIR: Less than.<br /><br />JAKE: Less!<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah!<br /><br />JAKE: Less! What?<br /><br />AMIR: But I'm very active in the subreddit. Yeah, I'm in there theorizing, postulating... actually stirring up a good amount of resentment, and... ill will towards you and me both.<br /><br />JAKE: [looking at his laptop] Okay, yeah. Here's your first post: \"I'm a key witness. I was in the library with Asia McClain. It was me, not Adnan. My name is Jake Hurwitz, ask me anythang.\"<br /><br />AMIR: Does posting in the subreddit make me a lawyer?<br /><br />JAKE: Of course not.<br /><br />AMIR: I mean, not necessarily.<br /><br />JAKE: Not at all.<br /><br />AMIR: But, it might make me a law clerk or, at the very least, a paralegal. I'm definitely, definitely at least a detective for it.<br /><br />JAKE: You're a detective?<br /><br />AMIR: I think so.<br /><br />JAKE: You just posted five minutes ago: \"MFW Sarah Koenig said the F-word,\" and... [clicking] ...it's a link to scat porn.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm a gumshoe. I'm a gumshoe of a detective, a rookie cop with a, with a chip on his shoulder!<br /><br />JAKE: You are so much less important than you think you are.<br /><br />AMIR: [quietly] Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE: Stop trying to half-assedly insert yourself into something successful, after the fact. It's lazy.<br /><br />AMIR: Went to visit Adnan yesterday.<br /><br />JAKE: ...No!<br /><br />AMIR: Was ready to offer him a conjugal, but the warden turned me down on Adnan's behalf!<br /><br />JAKE: That makes a lot of sense, man. You offered a conjugal visit to a convicted murderer?<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, spoiler much?<br /><br />JAKE: So you know nothing about the podcast. Have you listened to the one and a half episodes?<br /><br />AMIR: Downloaded! [holding up two fingers, one hooked to represent half] I said I've downloaded one and a half episodes!<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't! You said you listened!<br /><br />AMIR: I listened to part of one. I got to the MailChimp part, [pronounced \"MailKimp\", as in the podcast's ad] but I can really see why people are hot on this shit!<br /><br />JAKE: Cool, so you listened to one part of the ad, and you're still very active in the subreddit.<br /><br />AMIR: You don't have to know shit to be angry about shit. You just have to have an opinion, dumbass!<br /><br />JAKE: Your opinion doesn't have to be angry!<br /><br />AMIR: I'll often post without doing very much research at all, just passing off biased viewpoints as fact! Potentially redundant, definitely hurtful, and all caps, all the time, baby! Upvote!<br /><br />JAKE: S-- ...upvote?<br /><br />AMIR: Upvote!<br /><br />JAKE: Upvote what?<br /><br />AMIR: Upvote!<br /><br />JAKE: You want to upvote this? \"My name is Amir Hurwitz-Syed, and I am a member of Adnan's mosque. This is a picture of us playing ball back in the day. Even then, Adnan was a goofy killer, on the court. ;)\" [Jake reads this as \"winky face\", and Amir winks as he reads] \"Ask Me Almost Everything.\" And the picture's just a broken image. You wrote: \"Edit: This link works,\" and then that is a picture of your penis Photoshopped onto Adnan's high school yearbook photo. Small dick, by the way. You commented: \"Edit: Gotcha! But on the real, no lie, this is legit. This is the image. I had to dig through my mom's old photo albums,\" and that link is just...<br /><br />[Jake clicks, and Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" plays from his computer. Amir dances to the music.]<br /><br />JAKE: What's wrong with you?<br /><br />AMIR: And that made it to the front page! Wanna know why?<br /><br />JAKE: Because it didn't.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right! I'm lying, but it doesn't matter, because I'm loud, so you have to acknowledge me! That's the beauty of the internet! Ask me anythong! [pulls out a thong]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh...! Why were you wearing that?<br /><br />AMIR: Conjugal, motherfucker!<br /><br />END",

No. Stop it.<br /><br />AMIR: [deflecting a pad of Post-it notes] \"Top Ten Fish to Fry\", by Rodrigo O! [enunciating \"O\" as a strange moan]<br /><br />JAKE: Was that noise your new last name?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />JAKE: Why, oh why are interested in frying fish?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number ten: Could I borrow a pen?\" [deflecting a pen] \"So I could write down the name of this fish, ya bish! Makes girls sad, squirrels mad, and men grin! Look no further than the almighty... penguin.\"<br /><br />JAKE: Not a fish.<br /><br />AMIR: Not a bird!<br /><br />JAKE: You think anything that's not a bird is a fish? [Amir nods.] And yes, it is. It's a flightless bird.<br /><br />AMIR: That's a fightless turd.<br /><br />[Jake is speechless.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number nine: a sashimi is fine. You don't have to fry your really old dish. Just go to McDonald's and get a Filet-O-Fish.<br /><br />JAKE: So what are you saying? The number nine fish to fry is a...?<br /><br />AMIR: It's a sashimi.<br /><br />JAKE: So not frying a fish, but then getting a fried fish--<br /><br />AMIR: Um, yeah, a Filet-O-Fish.<br /><br />JAKE: --at McDonald's.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number eight: Fill your plate. When this fat fish died, we ate catfish, fried! But don't let this mustachian fool you. This fish is all woman... and a crustacean drool cube.\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...How are you getting dumber?<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE: Stop saying that. I've asked you.<br /><br />AMIR: ...Fair. \"Number seven: A Bacon named Kevin. That's right, this Footloose star has gone too far! I say we dip him in oil, and serve him to a horde of angry fans.\"<br /><br />JAKE: That's cannibalism!<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse?<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? Forget it. What has Kevin Bacon done that's gone too far? ...Please just done your work.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Done your work\"!<br /><br />JAKE: \"Do your work,\" I said.<br /><br />AMIR: [doing a Southern accent] \"Done your work!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Done your work. Do your work.<br /><br />AMIR: [still doing an accent] \"Hey, you over there! Let's all done our work--\"<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, I misspoke. You just said \"crustacean drool cube\", on purpose.<br /><br />[Amir quietly turns his attention to the scroll.]<br /><br />JAKE: Back to the list.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number six: Put your halibut on sticks. No need to fry it; that's bad for your diet. Not to mention it'll clog your arteries, and make you smell like a fartery. Pee-yew.\" [pause, then, pronouncing \"PU\"] \"Poo.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Pee-yew, poo\".<br /><br />[Amir chuckles.]<br /><br />JAKE: So twice on this list of top ten fish to fry, you've suggested not frying the fish. Once, you suggested we fry and eat Kevin Bacon--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Kevin Bacon.<br /><br />JAKE: I mean, what is wrong with you? [Amir doesn't respond.] This is so bizarre. Why is this our interaction? It's come to this.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number--\"<br /><br />JAKE: You've run out of ideas, haven't you.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number five...\"<br /><br />JAKE: You really have.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number five\". \"Number five is Ryan Gosling, starred in Drive--\"<br /><br />JAKE: So you want to fry and eat him as well.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding out his hand to interrupt Jake] Jumping to conclusions. \"What was his favorite fried fish, at the craft services table?\"<br /><br />JAKE: ...I don't know!<br /><br />AMIR: Do you not? ...Neither do I. I was hoping you'd, uh... [making a hopping motion with his hand] ...jump in right there with that.<br /><br />JAKE: Are you kidding me? What a weird hand motion.<br /><br />[Amir makes the motion a few more times. It looks progressively less like jumping.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...God, I hate your fingers.<br /><br />AMIR: Never matter. It's probably, like, lox or something.<br /><br />JAKE: Not a fried fish.<br /><br />AMIR: You think Gosling eats fried fish? Ya fucking idiot, he's an Adonis!<br /><br />JAKE: You said! You said, \"What's his favorite fried fish?\"<br /><br />AMIR: Gosling's on a strict no-fried-fish diet. You know it, I know it--<br /><br />JAKE: Now you know what he eats.<br /><br />AMIR: --the American people know it.<br /><br />JAKE: A second ago, you had no idea what he ate. Now you know whether he doesn't eat fried fish.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number four...\"<br /><br />JAKE: So why'd you include him on the list?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Drop your bass to the floor!\" [singing to the tune of \"Anaconda\" by Nicki Minaj] \"My big piranha don't want naan unless you fry that bun! Oh my cod. Look at that cut. Oh my cod. I like halibut--\"<br /><br />[Jake throws a pencil at Amir. Amir doesn't deflect it. The pencil stabs him in the throat and stays there.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Holy shit.<br /><br />AMIR: \"Number three: Is it dim in here, or is it just me?\"<br /><br />JAKE: I am sorry...<br /><br />AMIR: It's fine. \"Haddock--\" ...\"Haddock is--\" ...\"Number three...\"<br /><br />JAKE: We have to go to a hospital.<br /><br />AMIR: I'll go in a bit. \"Number two? Nah. It's tuna. Forget tilapia, whitefish, and speck.

The one thing written on it is \"1. This pencil's no fun. :( -Rodrigo O!\"]<br /><br />JAKE: ...You wizard. You warlock.<br /><br />AMIR: \"I taste only blood, perhaps a bit of lead. Soon the fried fish won't be all whom are dead. My friend did this to me, he's a murderous beast.

Mind if I pitch you some painting ideas?<br /><br />JAKE: What?<br /><br />AMIR: I'll take that as a no...<br /><br />JAKE: Great.<br /><br />AMIR: ...but I don't take no for an answer! Scoot over!<br /><br />JAKE: You're already sitting.<br /><br />AMIR: You're taking up the whole couch!<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, have you ever seen a painting of just, like, a fucking field? Not even of people. Just a landscape.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Of course.<br /><br />AMIR: [taken aback] Ow, that hurts...<br /><br />JAKE: You thought you were the first person ever to come up with the idea of painting nature?<br /><br />AMIR: Never mind, I said.<br /><br />JAKE: When did you say \"never mind\"?

Dumb.<br /><br />AMIR: Which is why I'm using this. [holds up a palette with paint]<br /><br />JAKE: You have paint. What would you use to get it on the canvas?<br /><br />AMIR: ...Oh, no!<br /><br />AMIR: See if you can wrap your fat little Jew cock around this idea: It's a portrait painting of a woman. [pauses] ...Hmm? Thoughts?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: Has it been done?<br /><br />AMIR: Alright, what if I forgo the canvas, and just straight up paint on a building?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, that's street art. That's pretty fun. Sure.<br /><br />AMIR: That's not fun, if it's been done!<br /><br />JAKE: That's an awful slogan, and a bad way to live your life. It insinuates that nobody but you can have a good idea.<br /><br />AMIR: Exactly right.<br /><br />JAKE: Yet all of your ideas so far have been unoriginal.<br /><br />AMIR: Forget it, I said!<br /><br />JAKE: No you didn't! You never said what you said you said. I don't think I've ever seen you say what you said you said.<br /><br />AMIR: You know, what the big issue is is that I was born too late, so all the good shit's already been done.<br /><br />JAKE: How dare you? You have every modern convenience. I mean, this is probably the only era that you could survive in--<br /><br />AMIR: I would have killed it in Egypt, as a slave. Did you know, actually, here's a-- ...I came up with the pyramids.<br /><br />AMIR: What about a dude?<br /><br />JAKE: Is your goal to paint something totally original?<br /><br />AMIR: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />JAKE: That's never been painted before?<br /><br />AMIR: That's right.<br /><br />JAKE: And your first three ideas were a dude--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Dude.<br /><br />JAKE: --a girl--<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] A girl.<br /><br />JAKE: --and a landscape.<br /><br />AMIR: Nature, yeah.

You're losing your adult teeth...<br /><br />[Amir smiles quickly.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...you eat like, and kind of resemble, a squirrel.<br /><br />[Amir is gnawing on an acorn.]<br /><br />JAKE: Kind of really resemble a squirrel. I mean, that's an acorn. And when I ask you a simple math question, you reply with a noise. Not a number, and not a word.<br /><br />AMIR: Gid is a word.<br /><br />JAKE: It's, of course, not a word.<br /><br />AMIR: Wanna bet?<br /><br />JAKE: Sure, yeah. Let's bet. If gid's not a word, you get rid of the compost bin.<br /><br />AMIR: And if it is a word, then I keep the compost, and you eat what's inside!<br /><br />JAKE: Sounds great.<br /><br />[Jake does an internet search. Amir watches expectantly.]<br /><br />JAKE: [bitterly] ...Get back to work. Jackass.<br /><br />AMIR: Is it a word?<br /><br />JAKE: Yes it is. Congrats, dummy. You've accidentally stumbled upon a word.<br /><br />AMIR Then you have to eat my compost.<br /><br />JAKE: No, I don't. I'm not gonna eat what's in that disgusting bin.<br /><br />AMIR: We made a bet!<br /><br />JAKE: Sorry about that, man. But I'll tell you what, hey, if you're upset, you can suck it!<br /><br />AMIR: ...What?<br /><br />[Jake stands up and does the crotch chop taunt.]<br /><br />JAKE: Suck it.<br /><br />AMIR: Murph!<br /><br />JAKE: No, no n-n-n-no! Come on, dude! Please! I don't want to be afraid today. It's my aunt's birthday.<br /><br />MURPH: [appearing from under Jake's desk] What's goin' on, fellas?<br /><br />JAKE: [reacting prematurely] Aaah! Ow! Aa-- ah. Hey, man! [throwing up a peace sign] What's up, man?<br /><br />MURPH: A lot is up. Amir said you reneged on a bet.<br /><br />JAKE: How do you know so fast?<br /><br />MURPH: Because we're tight.<br /><br />[Amir nods.]<br /><br />MURPH: What was the bet, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Honestly, it wasn't even a bet. It was just a-- we were just having a funny conversation. Alright? That was it. And if you'll leave me alone, I won't be afraid. My aunt's birthday is today, she's turning fifty-one, we have a nice little--<br /><br />MURPH: [yelling] What--<br /><br />[Jake jumps, and shakes in fear.]<br /><br />MURPH: ...was the bet, Jake?<br /><br />AMIR: He bet me gid wasn't a word, and it is a word.<br /><br />MURPH: Of course gid is a word. It's a disease found in sheep.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, fair enough. But he's making compost at the office. Alright? He's keeping filthy, weird, smelly soil here at work, and that's not okay, so... so I have an idea: why don't we team up? Me and you. One time. Jake and Murph. We'll make him afraid of us. [extends his hand for a shake]<br /><br />MURPH: Composting is an energy-efficient way to recycle and garden. It's plenty okay. What's not okay is reneging on bets. Now what were the stakes?<br /><br />JAKE: It was twenty dollars. Twenty-dollar iTunes gift card. And I'm gonna pony it up. I really will. And... sucks for my aunt, 'cause she's not gonna have a birthday gift, but--<br /><br />AMIR: Bull! He said he was gonna eat what was inside the compost!<br /><br />JAKE: Weak!<br /><br />[Amir hands the compost bin over to Murph, who takes out a piece of moldy bread.]<br /><br />MURPH: [making airplane noises] Here comes the airplane! Bread Blue, Flight 69!<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] Nice!<br /><br />JAKE: [covering his mouth] Uh, sorry, Flight Bread Blue, you do not have permission to land--<br /><br />[Murph forces the bread past Jake's hand and into his mouth.]<br /><br />MURPH: Mmm, what's it taste like, Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Limes.<br /><br />MURPH: Now let's get going to your aunt's shindig. I want to wish her a happy Murphday.<br /><br />JAKE: Murph, please don't. Please don't go. Murphy-- Brian!<br /><br />MURPH: [walking into the background] Where is she?<br /><br />END",

Okay, buddy? You asked for my thoughts, and now you're immediately telling--<br /><br />AMIR: Shhh!<br /><br />JAKE: You're shushing me?

And they stink, and so do you!<br /><br />JAKE: Nice, you butchered that phrase!<br /><br />AMIR: No.<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, why do you think you're wearing a good outfit for work?<br /><br />AMIR: Because it's healthy, dingus!

Yeah!<br /><br />[The tracking shot ends, and Amir is revealed to be wearing a baggy silver sweat suit.]<br /><br />JAKE: You're not working out in it, you're just--<br /><br />AMIR: It doesn't matter. The one issue, honestly, is that it's a little hot. It's steamy. But--<br /><br />JAKE: That's the sole purpose of the suit. It's supposed to be a sweat suit.<br /><br />AMIR: --it is shiny. I like that it's shiny, and actually, I trust Chard.<br /><br />JAKE: You trust him?<br /><br />AMIR: I do trust Chard, because he has a record label.<br /><br />SAM: [standing in the doorway of his office] Guys!

Alright, we've had two auditions at least, and, um, one or two table reads as well.<br /><br />SAM: That is three to four instances of work in the last eight years.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry, let me try to wrap my cock around this: you're saying me and you are done professionally?<br /><br />JAKE: Bad joke.<br /><br />AMIR: [laughing] It's not a joke!

I swear we'll write not just one episode for you, but an entire web series... eight hundred fucking episodes.<br /><br />JAKE: Way too many.<br /><br />SAM: Jesus.<br /><br />AMIR: And they'll be cheap, too.

I'm willing to experiment with this, but I agree with Jake.<br /><br />AMIR: Thi--<br /><br />SAM: Eight hundred episodes is too many.

I'm not gonna have it, at one point you-you had me throwing a computer against the wall.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine, what do you want the episode to be about?<br /><br />AMIR: About how I'm coool!<br /><br />JAKE: You loser.<br /><br />AMIR: Art imitating me...<br /><br />JAKE: Okay, fine, \"Interior: Office\", what are you saying?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm bragging, about how I can drink like a skunk.<br /><br />JAKE: Why is that funny?

Ben Schwartz... uh... hippity-holo... hologram?<br /><br />BEN pausing, looking confused: No. (at Amir) So I'm gonna talk to you for the rest of the time, is that fine?<br /><br />AMIR: So here's the situation, CollegeHumor's asking us to write the first episode in a webseries, okay? We want it to be great, something that can potentially last for, I don't know, eight years?<br /><br />BEN: Eight years? That seems reasonable. Uuuuh, how 'bout this, I'll give you some tips.<br /><br />AMIR: That'd be great.<br /><br />BEN: Alright cool, one of the tips I'd say is maybe one of you guys is really obsessed with the other one.<br /><br />Amir points knowingly at Jake<br /><br />BEN: Is he super into you all the time? Twenty-four-seven?<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, yeah, yeah!<br /><br />BEN: I love that, I love that!

You should have a catch phrase.<br /><br />AMIR: Ooh, I like that.<br /><br />BEN: You need one a lot like '80s or '90s television, like Urkel, in Family Matters'd be like:<br /><br />BEN: \"Did I do that?\"<br /><br />//<br /><br />JAKE: \"And I did that!\"<br /><br />BEN to Jake: No, you don't have to say it after me, and also you said it wrong. So, just for next time, it's: \"Did I do that?\"\t<br /><br />JAKE: Oh I did that!<br /><br />BEN: Stop. You don't have to repeat it after me, but just so you don't get embarrassed when you're in front of your friends, its- let's do it beat by beat: \"Did\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Did\"<br /><br />BEN: Alright, \"I\"-<br /><br />JAKE: -and I did that!<br /><br />BEN looking puzzled: No... Alright... Or like a different catch-phrase, you know what's a great one? In Cheers, every time George Wendt came into the bar they'd scream: <br /><br />BEN and AMIR: \"Norm!\"<br /><br />JAKE: Gnome!<br /><br />BEN: Norm<br /><br />JAKE: DAN!<br /><br />BEN: Stop. You can see my lips are saying \"Norm\"-<br /><br />JAKE: And I did that!<br /><br />BEN pausing: Ok, it doesn't matter<br /><br />JAKE: Alright.<br /><br />BEN: You know what would help us with all of this?<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />BEN: I have roommates back at home. Wanna go over there?<br /><br />AMIR: I'd be down.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah right, let me guess- the only way we can get back to your place is if you put your lips on my dick and blow me there.<br /><br />BEN looking shocked at Jake: ...nah. (To Amir) Do you want to head out?<br /><br />AMIR: Yes.<br /><br />BEN: Right.<br /><br />Amir and Ben leave the room.<br /><br />JAKE: I'm- down to go too.

What year could I get you, son?<br /><br />JAKE: Anything that's cold.<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: In my hand right now, I've got a vintage September 1242.<br /><br />JAKE: No, that sounds like it's way too old.<br /><br />BEN: Well...<br /><br />JAKE: It's antique milk.<br /><br />BEN: Who knows?<br /><br />[Amir shrugs.]<br /><br />JAKE: It's poison.<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Where's the shiner?<br /><br />JAKE: It's right here.<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman!<br /><br />JAKE: Yes, thank you, thank you--<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST [pouring chunky milk all over Jake's head] Here we go, and now we're feeling good in the hood! We're feeling good in the hood.<br /><br />JAKE: What the fuck are you--<br /><br />STANLEY: You're wasting all that cow juice!<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Way to go, gotta go!<br /><br />JAKE: ...Why did you do that?<br /><br />DOCTOR: Guys, I am a doctor. Everybody calm down. You shouldn't be pouring old milky cottage cheese on your face. Take the cold glass, and put it against your face!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I know.<br /><br />AMIR: You should have listened to the doctor, Jake.<br /><br />JAKE: Don't.<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: [singing and dancing] I hear we're writing a movie, I hear we're writing a movie! I hear we're writing a movie... but first, let's eat a snack!<br /><br />[Sulu Candles throws a bag of candy at Jake, and it hits him in the face.]<br /><br />STANLEY: You could have caught it if you had fingers, cow!<br /><br />JAKE: This is the worst day of my life.<br /><br />BEN: Ugh... what about the day you got your dick sucked?<br /><br />JAKE: ...That was up there too.<br /><br />BEN: Right.<br /><br />AMIR: The attempted dick-sucking.<br /><br />JAKE: Attem-- it happened.<br /><br />BEN: Sure.<br /><br />JAKE: Get that through your head.<br /><br />BEN: Sure.<br /><br />SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Oh, what's my name?<br /><br />AMIR: Geez, how many people live here? How'd you find this place?<br /><br />BEN: Actually, Cherry Dude found it for us, and he moved in.<br /><br />CHERRY DUDE: It was either this or a cupcake in La Cienega that'll drive ya wild!<br /><br />AMIR: I'd be down to live in a cupcake.<br /><br />JAKE: You already live in a muffin, [to Cherry Dude] thanks to you.<br /><br />CHERRY DUDE: Movin' on!<br /><br />BEN: Everybody, listen up: Jake and Amir are here because they want to write a web series, and they need a little help with the first episode.<br /><br />JOPE: Ooh, I'll DJ the premiere party. What about this... [singing] Hey, yo, my name is Drake... do you know my buddy Samuel... he's got a Razor scooter... go, Samuel, you're doing it!<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: And I will bring the milk!<br /><br />JAKE: Nobody drinks milk at parties.<br /><br />[As Charles Crooshtoost is talking, Sulu Candles tries to make Jake flinch with the bag of candy.]<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Okay, how old are the kids going to your parties? \"Nobody drinks milk at parties\"!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you party with children?<br /><br />BEN: Jake, why are you taking the wind out of everybody's sails? [to Amir] Is he always like this?<br /><br />JAKE: [gesturing to Charles Crooshtoost] He's a pedophile.<br /><br />AMIR: He's-- he's literally always negative to me, and he's always bringing me down.<br /><br />BEN: Oh my God. You know what? You have to start saying \"yes, and\" to things. That's how comedy works. You build upon things.<br /><br />[The interrogator returns.]<br /><br />INTERROGATOR: That's right, you piece of shit. So stop saying no and start saying yes! [lunges at Jake's pants]<br /><br />JAKE: Get out of here! Hey-- Ow! Get off of me, man!<br /><br />INTERROGATOR: Fine! It may be illegal now, but it won't be for long!<br /><br />JAKE: It's always gonna be against the law to do that.<br /><br />INTERROGATOR: [leaving] Oh, we'll see. My dad's in the Senate.<br /><br />JAKE: Alright, look, stop it. You guys can all help. Just one idea at a time, and no blowing me.<br /><br />BEN: Oh.<br /><br />AMIR: Or...<br /><br />BEN: Or?<br /><br />AMIR: ...everyone pitch their ideas at the same time and we get out of here fifty times quicker.<br /><br />BEN: So smart. Let's do that. I'll get my laptop. Let's go over here.<br /><br />JAKE: Not smart. It's actually a dumb idea.<br /><br />[Amir follows Ben and makes a two-person conga line.]<br /><br />BEN: [sitting down at his laptop] Everybody, on your marks, get set, go!<br /><br />[All of Ben's roommates begin talking over each other. Most of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony.]<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Fade up, on Charles Crooshtoost...<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: Open on a movie theater...<br /><br />CHERRY DUDE: ...in Wilshire. There he is...<br /><br />JOPE: ...What are they doing? They're trying to...<br /><br />CHARLES CROOSHTOOST: [singing] ...Hail to the milkman, the milkman, the milkman! Hail to the milkman, the milkman is me!...<br /><br />SCALBYLAUSUS JIM: ...never been stretched before. What are these called? Elbows...<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: ...all the snacks to themselves! What am I gonna do? How am I gonna do it?...<br /><br />STANLEY: ...and strikes the defender! \"Whoa, cow,\" he says, \"whoa!\"<br /><br />SULU CANDLES: ...What are we gonna do?...<br /><br />[Ben and Amir both type on the computer, and Amir laughs maniacally at what they're writing.]<br /><br />[A title card reads \"4 Hours Later\". Jake has toweled the milk off his face.]<br /><br />BEN: Done! ...Perfect, we did it!<br /><br />JAKE: No it's not. I didn't get a word in edgewise, guys. How many pages is this thing?<br /><br />BEN: Yeah-- it is... four hundred and two pages, but, to be fair, it is double-sided.<br /><br />JAKE: That is 804, then.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah, but you know what? I just double-checked it: it's way over a thousand.<br /><br />AMIR: That's okay. It's better to have over a thousand pages of garbage than four pages of gold.<br /><br />BEN: Yeah.<br /><br />JAKE: Completely disagree.<br /><br />BEN: Hey, what do you guys say about a wrap party, huh?<br /><br />[Ben hits a key, and Stony's remix \"The Milkman\" begins playing. Scalbylausus Jim and Sulu Candles start dancing, and Charles Crooshtoost mouths along to the words.]<br /><br />JAKE: [as Ben and Amir dance] How is this possible? These are sound clips from our actual lives.<br /><br />[A montage begins, set to \"The Milkman\", featuring outtakes from all of the episodes in which Ben Schwartz appeared.]<br /><br />LYRICS: (as in the video)  <br /><br />Listen up, everybody, this is the guy  <br /><br />That sucked my dick, sucked my dick<br /><br />Milkman please, milkman please  <br /><br />A glass of your least expired milk  <br /><br />Absolutely, I have July 13th (That's good, that's good)  <br /><br />1991 (Mmm, even better)<br /><br />Listen up, everybody, this is the guy  <br /><br />That sucked my dick, sucked my dick  <br /><br />(Listen up, everybody!)

Jake is waiting inside.]<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry! Couldn't find a meter spot to save my life! I had to valet like a chumpwad.<br /><br />JAKE: There is no valet. Why are you wearing that?<br /><br />AMIR: [jutting his golf bag out] Golf clubs!<br /><br />JAKE: Do you think I said \"What are you wearing\"? I said \"Why\".<br /><br />AMIR: I'm trying to be relatable, dimwit. You know, this is actually a pretty big problem you have: You often reject my shit at the face without really trying to understand and grasp the subtle nuance behind it. Zoom out!<br /><br />JAKE: We're meeting with high-power producers, trying to get them to give us money to fund the insane script that you wrote. The least you can do is act like a professional.<br /><br />AMIR: [imitating Christian Bale] Are you professional?<br /><br />JAKE: ...Stop with the Christian Bale shit.<br /><br />AMIR: Sorry!<br /><br />JAKE: It happened--<br /><br />AMIR: I just learned about it.<br /><br />[The two producers, later referred to as Lyle and Blanche, show up. Lyle shakes hands with Amir.]<br /><br />LYLE: Blumenfeld! Didn't know you golfed. Good man! What's your handicap?<br /><br />AMIR: I'm actually dyslexic.<br /><br />[Lyle laughs.]<br /><br />BLANCHE: I like this kid.<br /><br />LYLE: [pointing to the table] Yeah, we're back here...<br /><br />AMIR: It's pretty bad, actually.<br /><br />[At the table, Jake pitches the show.]<br /><br />JAKE: So... yes, it's low-concept, but what's exciting is developing the characters over time.<br /><br />BLANCHE: Well. I'm bored.<br /><br />AMIR: So am I. Blanche, Lyle, I apologize for my... insanely boring colleague. He doesn't realize that from him, even a little bit is too much.<br /><br />BLANCHE: Agreed.<br /><br />AMIR: But pass me the conch. [holding up his hand, which is in an actual conch] Allow me to beat your eardrums for just a minute here...<br /><br />LYLE: Please. Your friend is tedious.<br /><br />JAKE: Enough, Lyle.<br /><br />AMIR: My father was a quiet man. Proud. Growing up, we moved... a lot. I actually caught him one early, early morning, packing up our things -- plates, cups and whatnot -- and I told him \"Papa...\" [breaking from his story] Chinese fire drill! Chinese fire drill!<br /><br />JAKE: You--<br /><br />[Amir, Lyle and Blanche all get up and begin running around the table and laughing. Amir chases the other two.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get ya!<br /><br />[They go to sit back down. Lyle smacks Jake in the head.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ow, Lyle.<br /><br />BLANCHE: I feel young again!<br /><br />LYLE: We're prepared to write you a check, right now, for fifty thousand dollars.<br /><br />AMIR: This brunch is over. I'm sorry, but we reject your offer. It's not only a drop in the bucket, but it's a slap in the face. Lyle, you've underplayed your hand!<br /><br />LYLE: Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you knew how to play hardball. Can't blame an old exec for trying!<br /><br />AMIR: But you can teach one new tricks.<br /><br />[Lyle and Blanche laugh at length.]<br /><br />JAKE: It wasn't that good.<br /><br />BLANCHE: A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, cash in hand. All we want is to approve the outline.<br /><br />[Blanche hands a duffel bag to Amir, who immediately gives it to Jake.]<br /><br />AMIR: Jake. Count this cash.<br /><br />[Jake opens up the bag. It is full of bills.]<br /><br />AMIR: Though I'll tell you right now we're not accepting it, because we want complete creative control, Lyle!<br /><br />[Amir lights a match and throws it into the bag. Jake puts it out with a wad of bills.]<br /><br />AMIR: We want full fucking autonomy, Blanche.<br /><br />[Amir throws another match, which Jake puts out.]<br /><br />JAKE: Stop doing that.<br /><br />LYLE: That's absurd. There has to be some oversight!<br /><br />AMIR: The only oversight here is you, Lyle. As in: I'm over the sight... of your jowly face. [to Blanche] Of your... old pussy. I bid you guys namaste, I bid you guys adieu, I bid you all arrive-door-cheese. Jake, hand them the blood money back, please.<br /><br />LYLE: Keep it. Good luck, Amir. Oh, and Jake?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah?<br /><br />LYLE: You really fucking suck.<br /><br />AMIR: Oh, and Blanche?<br /><br />[Amir and Blanche both abruptly stand up, looking intensely into each other's eyes. They lean in slowly for a kiss.]<br /><br />AMIR: No... you misread this.<br /><br />[Amir stands up straight and leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: Valet!<br /><br />JAKE: Your car was stolen.<br /><br />AMIR: Right.<br /><br />END",

In a way, it determines which actors play which parts.<br /><br />JAKE: The last thing I said to you was \"casting is important; it determines which actors play which parts\". You just regurgitated that back to me, adding \"in a way\", which made it incorrect.<br /><br />AMIR: Let's watch the tapes.<br /><br />JAKE: Fine.<br /><br />[We see that Jake and Amir have set up a TV to watch the audition tapes. Rick Fox has sent one in. Amir points excitedly at the TV and looks at Jake.]<br /><br />RICK FOX: This is, uh, three-time NBA champion Rick Fox, auditioning for the role of Amir's bookie.

Uh, what a fun idea! I'm just gettin' the sides here now... Uh, [adopting a British accent] so this is Streeter Seidell, auditioning for the role, [laughs, drops the accent, then looks at the script] of Eater Pie-Fell. Eater P-- what the fuck, guys!<br /><br />AMIR: Ah, no. I bet he loves this, actually, 'cause his tears taste salty, and he'll just eat it.<br /><br />STREETER: [crying, eating a whole pie] You did this to me! I can't believe I'm gonna send this in! Why would I send this in?<br /><br />[Next is Sarah Schneider's tape.]<br /><br />SARAH: Hey guys! So happy you thought of me for the role of [air quotes] \"Sexy Babe That Makes Out with Jake Hard\"...<br /><br />[Jake grins at Amir.]<br /><br />SARAH: ...but there's no way I want that part. Bye!<br /><br />JAKE/AMIR: [simultaneously] Fuck!<br /><br />[Next is Hoodie Allen's tape.]<br /><br />HOODIE: Hi, uh, this is Hoodie Allen, reading for the role of Amir's rap teacher.

Yup, we just reviewed your tape, Mickey.<br /><br />JAKE: No we didn't.<br /><br />AMIR: You know what we thought, Mickey? I'll tell you what we thought, Mickey. Uh, we thought the same thing Olivier thought when he discovered Brando, Mickey: that we feel like we have a star on our hands, and we don't want to fuck it up, Mickey! Mickey, there is so much untapped potential within you, Mickey! I had no idea, Mickey! [crying] I just... I want to do you proud, Mickey, because I know you'll do us proud. That's why, Mickey! In fact, we just got off the phone with your manager, your agent, and your lawyer. They held our feet to the flame, and we gave in a hundred and ten percent! You got points on the back end, Mickey! [laughs] You got points on the front end! My lawyer didn't know what to do with himself! He was beside himself, Mickey! And I said as soon as you see what-- what I saw in this guy that I had known for my entire life, Mickey, I just-- I had no idea, Mickey! It was beautiful to see, Mickey, this transformation! When did you vacation in a cocoon and emerge as a beautiful butterfly, Mickey? Go to deadline.com, Mickey. Go to deadline.com right now, Mickey. It's a Hollywood-style gossip blogzine, Mickey, and you, my friend, are on the front page. The picture they used is a little outdated, but the headline is very much so loud and clear: Hollywood's New A-List Celeb! You're the talk of the town, Mickey! You know why, Mickey? 'Cause you're the star of our fucking short, Mickey! You're the star of our new web series, do you see it? You don't see it yet? G-- hit Refresh, Mickey! Command-R, Mickey?

'Cause we d-- ...because you sucked, Mickey! Your read was flat, Mickey, it was uninspired, Mickey, and you're frankly not that good of an actor, Mickey! Truth be told, we didn't even review your fucking tape, Mickey, that's how sure I am that ya suck, Mickey! Goodbye, Mickey! Goodbye forever... Mickey!<br /><br />[Amir hangs up.]<br /><br />[On the other end, we see Mickey, played by Ed Helms. Mickey hangs up the phone.]<br /><br />MICKEY: [laughs] Oh, Amir. You get me every time...<br /><br />[Mickey starts crying.]<br /><br />MICKEY: Come on, Mickey! ...Get it together, man... don't let him suck you in again.<br /><br />[Mickey sits silently in his office.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm gonna miss that guy.<br /><br />END",

I'm Cliff Blinky.<br /><br />MARISA: No, that guy over there is Cliff Bleszinski. I saw him when we walked in.<br /><br />[Marisa and Cliff nod at each other.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, you know what? Forget it, 'cause I'm hungry. Me want sushi. Here we go, who wants some fresh fish?<br /><br />[Amir tries and fails to throw fish into his mouth, hindered by the armor.]<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, that was closer than I thought-- and... here we go-- here we go-- alright.<br /><br />MARISA: Maybe you should use chopsticks if you're gonna eat sushi.<br /><br />AMIR: [mocking her] \"Maybe you should use... ch--\" ...sorry, what were you gonna say? I, I was gonna-- [to Jake] I was gonna make fun of her, but I forgot what she was gonna say--<br /><br />JAKE: I know what you were gonna do. Just leave, man! I'm on a date!<br /><br />AMIR: Well now you're on a not. [punches the food] Boo-ya!<br /><br />MARISA: What are you doing?<br /><br />AMIR: I'll tell you guys what I'm doing: I'm about to cook you guys a legit feast. Huh? How's that sound?<br /><br />JAKE: We have a feast, okay? You're ruining it.<br /><br />AMIR: No, no, no, no no no. It's not a date until I make my famous crepes! [stands up awkwardly]<br /><br />JAKE: I thought you said it wasn't a date. You said we were on a not.<br /><br />AMIR: BRC, alright? Be right... crepe. [leaves for the kitchen]<br /><br />JAKE: I'm really sorry. I don't know that guy.<br /><br />MARISA: Mm-hmm.<br /><br />[Cliff Bleszinski joins them. Jake throws up his hands in defeat.]<br /><br />CLIFF: I couldn't help but notice how badly this is going. I'm Cliff.<br /><br />MARISA: I know who you are! I'm Marisa.<br /><br />CLIFF: And I know who you are.<br /><br />[Marisa laughs.]<br /><br />JAKE: [laughing sarcastically] Hey Cliff, man, look: We all love Games of Worms. Alright, we all do. But honestly, I'm on a date right here, so. Bro code.<br /><br />CLIFF: Bro code?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah. Bro code.<br /><br />MARISA: ...So, Gears 3, huh? I'm unbelievably pumped.<br /><br />CLIFF: You should be excited. It's gonna be big.<br /><br />JAKE: [mocking] \"It's gonna be big!\"<br /><br />AMIR: [returning from the kitchen] Hey bro, do you know where the rice pots are?<br /><br />JAKE: I thought you were making crepes.<br /><br />AMIR: Yeah, I am. Amir style. That's with a whole lot of rice.<br /><br />JAKE: You don't need any rice. And that's not my kitchen, by the way, so I wouldn't know where the rice pot is.<br /><br />AMIR: Okay, well the chef is being super uncooperative, man!<br /><br />[Brief flashback to Amir kicking the chef in the gut.]<br /><br />AMIR: That's right... I'll teach you... for being a chef!<br /><br />AMIR: Either way, now I can't find jack squat.<br /><br />JAKE: Then don't make it.<br /><br />AMIR: What?<br /><br />JAKE: Just go.<br /><br />[Amir leaves, headed for the kitchen again.]<br /><br />CLIFF: So, uh, I got some food back at my house. You want to go back, uh, maybe get some dinner, have a sneak peek at the game?<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, thanks, dude, but she's not hungry--<br /><br />MARISA: Yes, I do.<br /><br />[Cliff and Marisa leave arm in arm.]<br /><br />JAKE: Take a hint, man... alright...<br /><br />[Amir is back in the kitchen, holding two raw Cornish hens.]<br /><br />AMIR: Guys, screw it. I'm making you Cornish hens instead. That's right, an after-dinner bird, and it's gonna be delicious. [putting the birds directly on the stove element] Here we go, all right, one time! Hey Cliff, how's that sound, man? Ever had a frickin' turkey for dessert before? [laughs] Okay, which one of these is fire? [fumbling with the knobs]<br /><br />[The screen reads \"GEARS OF WAR 3\"; \"SEPTEMBER 20\"; \"WORLDWIDE\".]<br /><br />[Jake and Amir are sitting at the table. Amir raises his hand for a high five.]<br /><br />JAKE: Not gonna high five you.<br /><br />AMIR: Alright. I wouldn't, just 'cause I've been touching raw meat.<br /><br />[The video closes off with the Xbox and Microsoft logos.]",

Amir has a megaphone.]<br /><br />AMIR: [patting Jake on the knee] Good shoot, as they say! Good shoot!<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please not? Alright? That was an absolutely harrowing experience.<br /><br />AMIR: Nobody said making art would be easy.<br /><br />JAKE: You cut off your own dick today, man.<br /><br />AMIR: [through the megaphone] Excuse...?<br /><br />JAKE: You stepped out of your trailer in front of a huge plume of crystal meth smoke. You strode onto the set, put your penis through the slate, and said \"'The Entire Crew Screams and Calls 911', take two,\" and slammed the device on your shaft. Your genitals hit the floor with a sickening slap, and everyone stood in stunned silence for an eternity.<br /><br />[Amir accidentally sets off the megaphone's siren, but turns it off. Jake snatches it away from him.]<br /><br />AMIR: Oh!<br /><br />JAKE: You never stopped smiling through the whole entire thing, even as you bled out through the stump on your mound, even as the paramedics arrived, and failed to reattach your reproductive organ. You kept yelling, \"I'll be a better director as a eunuch! My libido won't guide my eye!\"<br /><br />[Amir gestures along as Jake quotes him, raising his arms for emphasis and then pointing at his eye.]<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sorry if I went dickless for Michael Chiklis. I'm serious. [air quotes] I apologize if I \"inconvenienced anybody\".<br /><br />JAKE: You inconvenienced everybody. Eventually, you convinced the paramedics to attach your big toe to your pelvic bone to use as your phallus. You said \"as long as it's chubby, a girl will rubby\". I will never forget that weird rhyme as long as I live.<br /><br />AMIR: Huh... Thank you--<br /><br />JAKE: Not a compliment. You also rented an IMAX camera, for no reason. That's a hundred thousand dollars, for the day, out of our budget, and you didn't even shoot anything interesting! You laid it on the ground, and paraded a bunch of construction paper dinosaurs around in front of it.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding a paper pterodactyl out in front of him] Welcome, to Jurassic Shart?<br /><br />JAKE: So dumb. Don't--<br /><br />[Amir grunts and squirms for a long time, and shits without farting. He throws the pterodactyl down in frustration.]<br /><br />JAKE: Great. You shit your pants without farting. So it's not even a shart; it's just a shit.<br /><br />AMIR: [frustrated] Anal!<br /><br />JAKE: What are you gonna do without a penis?<br /><br />AMIR: Let me ask: Why are you so fixated on that small part of the day?<br /><br />JAKE: \"Fixated on that\"... it's a small part of you.<br /><br />AMIR: A lot of other stuff happened, by the way!<br /><br />JAKE: You know what? I'm fixated because you castrated yourself publicly!<br /><br />AMIR: [sarcastically] Oooooh!<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah! Yeah, you ruined today! We didn't get any good footage!<br /><br />AMIR: It's there in pieces!<br /><br />JAKE: Your penis is in pieces!<br /><br />AMIR: Excuse you! Absolutely excuse you!<br /><br />JAKE: Excuse you. You monster.<br /><br />AMIR: By the way, whatever we didn't get today, we pick up tomorrow! That's why it's called a pick-up!<br /><br />JAKE: What money do we shoot the pick-ups with? You blew the entire budget! A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars gone, spent on an IMAX camera and a lunch comprised entirely of bird's nest soup! It's a Chinese delicacy. It cost forty-five hundred dollars a bowl, which of course meant we didn't even get to feed the entire crew of fifty people.<br /><br />AMIR: [holding up a finger to stop Jake] I had a KIND bar.<br /><br />JAKE: Oh good! Good, so you ate.<br /><br />AMIR: I had a KIND bar--<br /><br />JAKE: You also had soup!<br /><br />AMIR: --and soup! I had a KIND bar and soup, which I think is f--<br /><br />JAKE: How is that fair? Other people didn't eat anything at all!<br /><br />AMIR: Let's talk post-production for a second.<br /><br />JAKE: Insane.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm thinking in terms of editing, I can cut the bitch up myself.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to--<br /><br />AMIR: I mean, I do have iMovie.<br /><br />JAKE: Do you know how to edit?<br /><br />AMIR: You know what? Suck my fuckin' toe, dude!<br /><br />JAKE: Good, good reaction.<br /><br />[Amir unzips his pants and whips out his relocated big toe.]<br /><br />AMIR: Suck my toe!<br /><br />JAKE: Oh!

Everything on it.<br /><br />AMIR: You had an everything bagel?<br /><br />JAKE: No! Listen to the story, ass. I had a plain bagel; I put everything on it. The whole shabazz. I had lox.<br /><br />ANGIE: So just lox.<br /><br />JAKE: Yes. Just--<br /><br />AMIR: Then why do you have a seed?<br /><br />JAKE: Why are you two ganging up on me right now?

You struck me!<br /><br />ANGIE: So it's not a movie? ...So what's the TV show, then?<br /><br />JAKE: Not a TV show either. It's much better than both of those things, alright? This is the internet.  You ever heard of a YouTube? ...This show's gonna be on one.<br /><br />ANGIE: I thought you said this was a premiere.<br /><br />JAKE: I said a lot of things, okay? I said I was Adam Lambert's cousin Drew! But that-- does that mean you wouldn't be coming on this date with me if I weren't rich, connected, and famous? It's like--<br /><br />[Angie opens the door of the limo and jumps out. Sounds of car horns and swerving can be heard off-screen.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ohh!<br /><br />JAKE: No! N-- ohh, freak-- come on!<br /><br />[Jake is snorting something off his wrist.]<br /><br />JAKE: Ohh!<br /><br />AMIR: Whoa! Was that cocaine?<br /><br />JAKE: Nah, dude. Powdered sugar.

Alright, come on, dude, we're here! Let's do this!<br /><br />AMIR: What are you doing?<br /><br />JAKE: Reader's Digest calls it \"disheveled after-party look\", the style of mid-2015. Or was Wilmer Valderrama at his accountant's twin sons' b'nai mitzvah not styling?<br /><br />AMIR: \"Disheveled after-party look\"?<br /><br />JAKE: A messed-up tux for these dumb fucks makes the ladies go \"yuck!\" ...I tossed the salad of a duck.

The second-coolest kind of rave.<br /><br />AMIR: How much sugar did you snort?<br /><br />JAKE: You know, it was a lot, and I also skipped dinner. I lied about the bagel, lied about the lox.

The marquee outside reads \"COLLEGEHUMOR PRESENTS: AMIR AND JAKE; A WEBSERIES ABOUT TWO BEST FRIENDS\". Inside, Amir and Jake walk across the stage into the spotlight. The are met with applause from an audience of their co-workers.]<br /><br />AMIR: Ladies... gentlemen... Paul...<br /><br />[Murph, who is sitting beside Paul Briganti, laughs uproariously.]<br /><br />PAUL: ...Why are you mean to me?<br /><br />AMIR: What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />SAM: Uh, excuse me: \"movie\"? It's supposed to be a short web clip.<br /><br />AMIR: Started off as that. But the more we worked on it, the more this bird wanted to be a plump, plump princess, a tubby fowl.<br /><br />JAKE: It's off to, you know, a little bit of a rough start, but I think with some patience, Sam, I really think we can... we can find our voice.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] It has full frontal!... It has full backal!<br /><br />JAKE: It's quirky. That's true. But I believe we can find some dedicated weirdos to laugh along with us.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] I'm a dumbass! I'm a dumbass extraordinaire, and I was in charge of making it, and then I, I did it!<br /><br />JAKE: Okay. I play Jake, uh, everyday straight man...<br /><br />[Amir waves.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...opposite my annoying co-worker, Amir.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] I play me: Jake!<br /><br />JAKE: You play Amir.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling] Henry!<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] You're getting overly excited. [to the audience] Alright, Amir plays an over-the-top--<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling and shaking] --demented dumbass Jew with a black heart and a raisin toe dick, who gets off to making Jake proud and nothing else!<br /><br />JAKE: Calm down, please.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling, shaking] I am calm!<br /><br />JAKE: You're shaking.<br /><br />AMIR: [yelling, shaking] I love being in front of people! I'm famous today! [stomps]<br /><br />SAM: [to himself] What have I done...<br /><br />JAKE: We've taken up enough of your time. We'll just let you guys enjoy the movie.<br /><br />[Jake walks off-stage, dragging along Amir, who is still vibrating with energy.]<br /><br />AMIR: [still yelling] Yeah! In the beginning is when I cut my dick off in it!<br /><br />[As the movie plays, Jake and Amir stay backstage. Jake is waiting nervously, but Amir has begun doing his celebratory dance.]<br /><br />AMIR: Henry!... Henry!...<br /><br />JAKE: Can you please stop celebrating? We don't even know how it's going in there.<br /><br />AMIR: I'm sure it's doing great!<br /><br />[Sam enters the backstage area.]<br /><br />SAM: Alright guys! You are fired.<br /><br />JAKE: Of course.<br /><br />AMIR: [simultaneously] Why?<br /><br />SAM: I just saw you amputate your penis... asshole!<br /><br />JAKE: [to Amir] Why did you leave that in?<br /><br />AMIR: It's art!<br /><br />SAM: What the fuck is \"backal\"?<br /><br />[In the theater, the audience can be heard groaning loudly in disgust.]<br /><br />AMIR: Probably just missed it!<br /><br />[Pat runs into the backstage area and bee-lines for the trash can to vomit. The lid only opens once he has finished throwing up, splattering his vomit on the back wall.]<br /><br />PAT: I can never unsee that.<br /><br />[Pat walks away, staring daggers at Jake and Amir as he leaves.]<br /><br />AMIR: It is memorable. Agreed.<br /><br />SAM: Yeah, you guys are done at CollegeHumor. I might be done at CollegeHumor! I now have to distance myself from the two of you.<br /><br />[Sam walks away, only turning back to scream a few thoughts at them.]<br /><br />SAM: \"Backal\"?... Assholes! ...Fuck! ...My parents died in a plane crash!...<br /><br />[Jake and Amir have returned to the CollegeHumor building alone. They sit in the silent office, packing up their desks. Amir picks up a pen, tries to twirl it between his fingers, and fails.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Hey, do you know any pen tricks?<br /><br />JAKE: Focus on being sad. Alright? Let the feeling of failure wash over you.<br /><br />[Amir makes a defensive face to dismiss Jake. Eventually, though, he leans back meditatively in his chair and takes a deep breath, taking in the situation. He nods sadly.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...You jumped the carp tonight, man.<br /><br />JAKE: Excuse me?<br /><br />AMIR: Didn't want to say anything, [swinging the pen like a small baseball bat] but you came out swinging and whiffing! [laughs] I think we should have stuck to the original script, the original plan.<br /><br />JAKE: That's what I'm saying. [picking up the original script, tossing a copy to Amir] Look at this thing! It was so easy to produce, we could have shot it ourselves on one of these.<br /><br />[Jake holds up a small digital camera. He hands it to Amir, who studies it.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Huh.<br /><br />JAKE: Come on. What's your first line?<br /><br />[Amir clears his throat, holds the camera at arm's length to his side, and begins recording. The video they record is the 2007 Jake and Amir episode \"Beer\". During their read we see glimpses of Amir's recorded footage, which is that of the original episode.]<br /><br />AMIR: \"So drunk...\"<br /><br />JAKE: Uh-- \"You're drunk right now?\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"Last night, I got so drunk...\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Um... you-- ...nice.\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I had, like, so many beers.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"How many? How many is so many?\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I was, like, retarded.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"How many beers did you have?\"<br /><br />AMIR \"...Sixty.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Sixty? That's... sixty is way too many. That's not a believable number at all.\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I know... how many is believable?\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"Twelve?\"<br /><br />AMIR: \"I know. Twelve. I had twelve beers. I was... stupid afterwards.\"<br /><br />JAKE: \"I don't think you even know-- I don't think you've had any beer, ever.\"<br /><br />[Amir pauses, losing motivation to continue reading.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...Actually, this is pretty bad.<br /><br />AMIR: It was funny when we wrote it.<br /><br />JAKE: Yeah, I guess so...<br /><br />[They both put their copies of the script in their boxes. Amir sighs.]<br /><br />JAKE: ...So what's next?<br /><br />[Amir pauses for a long time as he tries to think of an answer.]<br /><br />AMIR: ...Dinner tonight?<br /><br />[Jake quietly contemplates Amir's offer, and takes a last look around the offices of CollegeHumor. The screen cuts to black.]<br /><br />[A credits sequence for the series plays, set to My Chemical Romance's \"Black Parade\" (in the CollegeHumor upload, an instrumental song is used).
