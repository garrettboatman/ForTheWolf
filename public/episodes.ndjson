It's - I mean it's pointless anyway because it's far away [sticks arm inside his blue polo shirt] it's never going to- \n\nJake pushes his hand out the top of his polo. Because his arm is inside the shirt, it appears as though the hand is by itself.\n\nJake: [fake frightened] OH NO!\n\nAmir sees the hand and begins screaming hysterically.

Amir is still crying.\n\nJake: Hey, hey, hey, hey, [shows Amir his arm] it was my hand. It was my... [Jake lets out a pity laugh (this could have been a blooper), then sighs and pulls on his polo] No, no! Look! [Shows Amir the inside of his shirt] Hey! Look at my shirt! There's nothing inside my shirt, right?\n\nAmir has his hands to his face. He is no longer crying, but he is still whimpering. Jake shows his arms to Amir.\n\nJake: And - and there's no hand. There's no hand. It was my hand all along.\n\nAmir grabs onto Jake and starts hitting him with his right hand. Jake embraces Amir and pats him on his left shoulder.\n\nAmir: [still scared] I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate-\n\nJake: You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine. Come on, you okay? You're fine. [Jake looks up] He's fine!\n\nCut to 8 co-workers staring confused and awkwardly at Jake and Amir.\n\nJake: [waving them off] He's fine, He's fine.\n\nCut back to Jake and Amir, who are hugging each other less tightly. \n\nJake: He's a big boy. Smile like a big boy!\n\nAmir smiles widely with his teeth clenched. His eyes are squeezed shut. Jake rocks him gently.\n\nJake: [Smiling and patting Amir on the back] Smile like a big boy! Huh? You wanna get ice cream?\n\nAmir: [still crying, shakes his head] No.\n\nJake: No, K, [pats Amir on the shoulder] you're fine, you're gonna be okay. [looks up at the co-workers] He's fine.

All of a sudden, you're not making many steps, right? (JAKE: You step in) You have to always- So we're telling you, out-think the Chinese proverbs, because, (JAKE: That's.. vaguely racist, and I don't think we should--) yes, they're smart, but, we can be better than that. And it takes.. just one person, to make it--\n\nJAKE: You heard it from Amir: we can be better than the Chinese. Is that what you want to say?--\n\nAMIR: What? That's- When you say it like that it's mean, and that's not what I meant. We can be just as good as they are.\n\nJAKE: We are- Everybody's equal! That's..--\n\nAMIR: Not at math!\n\n(Amir waves at the camera.)\n\nJAKE: Alright, everybody, have a really fun and enriching weekend.--\n\nAMIR: And don't just use this weekend to hook up with other people (JAKE: That's f--); you're to young to kiss, anyway.\n\nJAKE: They're n-- How old were you when you kissed a girl?\n\nAMIR: What?\n\nJAKE: Freshman, in c- high school..

I sense it. \n\n(Jake slams into the glass wall and they start shoving each other) \n\nSARAH: Well, that's true. And, I mean, Amir like sleeps over Jake's house constantly.\n\n(Amir slaps Jake, Jake removes Amir's shirt)\n\nPAT: Yes! And then remember Christmas? They went home together.\n\nSARAH: That's so true.

I mean, the family visits, the sleepovers, they're always getting into these like lover's quarrels. \n\nPAT: Lover's quarrels?\n\nSARAH: Yeah, I mean . . . maybe. It's stupid, it's probably wrong, but...\n\n(Amir and Jake are still on the floor wrestling, Amir on top of Jake and Jake's legs up in the air) \n\nPAT: Yeah, I mean, Jake punched me when we slept together, (chuckles) remember?\n\nSARAH: Yeah. \n\nPAT: I'm sorry.\n\nSARAH: No, it's OK.

But I thought that that meant we wouldn't talk like outside the office or something. \n\n(Amir and Jake give each other a low five, both panting) \n\nSARAH: I mean, or ever.\n\nPAT: Or if it came up organically. \n\nSARAH: I mean--\n\nAMIR (walking by shirtless): Hey.\n\nPAT: Hey.\n\nJAKE (walks by, also shirtless): What up?\n\nPAT: OK, that was--\n\nTHE END. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWPO0JqH3Nk\n\n", "duration": "1:40", "air_date": "2009-06-25", "scribe": "PBdolphin23", "_type": "episode"}

You either knew, or you thought it was a letter. \n\nAMIR: Then I thought it was a letter. \n\nJAKE: OK, I know. Look, even if by some small miracle everybody in this office gave a s**t that it was your half birthday and they wanted to clap for you so loudly that you could even *ask* them to stop, if you needed to display a message on your chest, wouldn't you feel weird about admitting that you knew all of this all along? \n\nAMIR: I'm going to f***ing kill Leron if there's an arrow on my back, I swear. \n\nTHE END. \n\nOUTRO\n\nAMIR: He's done, simple as that.

[Takes deck of cards from Amir]\n\nAmir: Yeah. \n\nAmir has the deck of cards. Jake is looking away from him with his arms on the table. He is exhausted and pissed off.

I also am not completely familiar with all the guys' voices so some names may not be right when someone's talking off-screen. There were a ton of inaudible things I just couldn't put together so if y'all could help, that would be awesome comploodle. Be as nitpicky as possible. :P Oh, and a huge congratulations to the cumulative and collaborative effort of this subreddit to have now officially transcribed every single Jake and Amir video ever.

It sounded a lot like you were reading from Wikipedia, but I know for a fact that you couldn't have been because you were raising your eyes to look at me every few seconds to prove that you were speaking your own original thoughts.\n\nAMIR: Absolowly.\n\nJAKE: You mean absolutely.\n\nAMIR: (stumbling as he makes up a definition) No, uh, I mean absolowly, which is.. Franish for.. absolutely.\n\nJAKE: Oh, ok. At first I thought you misspoke, but the way you spun it around on me, and me realize that I was wrong, makes you look smart, and me look stupider by comparison. (Amir makes a variety of strange faces). Especially because I didn't even know Franish was a language, but I know that it must be, because you said it with such conviction and confidence. Even now as I talk, you're just nodding your head, which makes me realize that you knew you were right all along--\n\nAMIR: (rapping) Yo yo SO, son, I wanna jump around and make ya go.... AAAH! (Amir's aaah noise)\n\nJAKE: That was a tight rap. (Amir continues making strange faces.) Normally raps have to rhyme, but you delivered it in such a way that made you seem like a professional freestyler. You know, even when you seemingly couldn't think of the next word you kind of just went aaah and shook your head, which made me realize that you were purposefully done talking. As a result, I'm your good friend now and I want to hang out more, take you to McDonald's and just generally hang you with you as much as possible.\n\n(Amir pumps his arms up and down with his palms upward.)\n\nJAKE: Now you're raising the roof, which I thought was outdated, but I know that it can't be outdated because you're doing it. I've grown to respect you so much in the last few minutes. I'm realizing you're not getting my sarcasm, even though I'm laying it on very thick.\n\n(Amiir squints and nods.)\n\nJAKE: Now you're squinting and nodding because you know you should be comprehending something, but you're still not.\n\n(Amir smiles.)\n\nJAKE: And now you're smiling because you think that I think that you understand--\n\nAMIR: (childishly impatient and exasperated) Are we gonna go the the Dees or not?!\n\nEND.\n\n", "duration": "1:57", "air_date": "2009-09-03", "scribe": "seeegma", "_type": "episode"}

So I grab her right [grabs Jake again] and she finally wrestles loose and she goes to call, I don't know, her supervisor or whatever [begins to rustle through Sarah's bag] but it's complete darkness in there so I start freaking out.\n\nJake sees Amir going through Sarah's bag\n\nJake: [Whispers angrily] Hey, hey, get your hand out of Sarah's bag OK? She is right there.\n\nPan over to Sarah who is sitting at her desk wearing headphones and facing her computer. Pan back to Amir who continues going through the bag.\n\nAmir: [chuckles] What do I care? So you know it's complete darkness in there, I'm crying but it's starting to burn because [in a weird voice] my eyes are broken or whatever-\n\nJake: Stay out of Sarah's bag\n\nAt this moment Amir pulls a pink tampon out of Sarah's bag. He puts his hands up as if he were surrendering without noticing the tampon in his hand.\n\nAmir: OK, relax. [looks at tampon] Oh...\n\nJake closes his eyes then massages his forehead.\n\nJake: [Looks away] Put that away. Put that away. Put that away.\n\nAmir unwraps the tampon and smells it.\n\nJake: Amir don't. [Massages forehead again] Do you know what that is? Do you know what it is?\n\nAt this point Amir holds the tampon is his mouth. He is moving it around inside his mouth while moaning.\n\nAmir: Oh, oh, ahaha!\n\nJake: Sarah! Hey, Sarah.\n\nThe camera pans to Sarah again who turns around and sees Amir with the tampon in his mouth. \n\nAmir is now making gargling noises. \n\nAmir appears to be stuffing the tampon down his throat. \n\nThe camera cuts to Jake with a confused look on his face.\n\nThe camera cuts back to Amir who has closed his mouth on the tampon. The string at the end sticks out of his mouth.\n\nThe camera cuts to Sarah who looks at Amir with disgust.\n\nThe camera cuts back to Amir. (It is implied that) the tampon is completely inside his mouth now. He swallows. His face which was smiling before, now looks concerned and scared.\n\nJake: Wow, are you ok?\n\nAmir: [speaks in wheezes] I'm fine.\n\nJake: Good, so you're not choking or anything?\n\nAmir: [speaks in wheezes] Choking? Haha, don't make me laugh. [Laughs]\n\nJake: [in unison with Amir's laugh, but with concern] Hahahahahaha, so you don't need the Heimlich?\n\nAmir: [still wheezing] Heimlich, what are you crazy? I'm gonna go get lunch [Jake nods], um, do you want anything?\n\nJake: [Shakes his head] Nope. I don't.\n\nAmir: [wheezing] I'm going to peace on outta here [makes peace sign with his hands]\n\nJake: Alright, peace out.\n\nAmir begins to wheel himself away, pushing Jake's chair in the process. Amir seems to be calm while Jake is still freaking out.\n\nAmir: But, oh, by the way, before I forget, [takes deep breath in] what's the name of that song that goes [starts dancing in his chair. Jake does the same, calmer now] Come my lady/come come my lady/you're my butterfly.\n\nAt the same time:\n\nJake: Sugar-\n\nAmir: [grabs Jake's shirt] I'M GONNA DIE!\n\nJake quickly gets up while Amir wheezes and struggles to breathe. Jake goes around Amir and begins doing the modified Heimlich maneuver because Amir is in a wheelchair.\n\nCut to Sarah who looks extra concerned.\n\nCut back to Jake and Amir. Jake continues to do the Heimlich maneuver until the tampon falls out of Amir's mouth. Amir begins to struggle and cough. The tampon falls to the floor. Amir begins to breathe forcefully, still a little wheezing.\n\nCut back to Sarah, who is still concerned.\n\nJake: [relieved] God, that was close.\n\nJake pats Amir on the back and ANOTHER tampon falls out of his mouth, then onto the floor. Jake and Sarah exchange confused looks.\n\nAmir: By the way it's Sugar Ray's Butterfly is the song.\n\nJake: [shakes his head] That's not true.\n\nAmir: Yea, I know it's not.\n\n", "duration": "1:35", "air_date": "2009-09-29", "scribe": "guitargrl34", "_type": "episode"}

How does what, [pause] save you any time, that is.\n\nJake: How does wiping before you shit save you any time?\n\nAmir: It does.\n\nJake: I would like to know how.\n\nAmir: And I'm telling you that it is, a time saver.\n\nJake: I believe you that you believe it's a time saver.\n\nAmir: And I believe you, that you believe me, that is, because it is.\n\nJake: Ok, but just tell me how it saves time.\n\nAmir: Ya just do it! You wipe, and then you shit.\n\nJake: You're just explaining that you do it. [Amir nods] But you're not saying why it saves time.\n\nAmir: You don't have to because it does.\n\nJake: Ok!\n\nAmir: Ok!\n\nJake: That's fine!\n\nAmir: Hm hm!\n\nJake: Good!\n\nAmir: [High-pitched] Yeah!\n\nJake: All right.\n\nAmir: [High-pitched] Yep!\n\nJake: I don't think it saves anytime but, we can agree to disagree.\n\nAmir: [Laughs] We can agree to agree because it does! AHH!\n\nJake: We don't have to agree on everything and that's fine.\n\nAmir: [Laughing] It is fine, because it does.\n\nJake: You are wrong sometimes.\n\nAmir: I am never wrong sometimes.\n\nJake: Because this doesn't change the two things that you have to do which is shit and wipe. It just switches the order. Maybe if you didn't wipe at all, but...\n\nAmir: Yes but if you switch the order it makes it so time is saved so, ahh! [laughs]\n\nJake: You don't switch the order of things and save time.\n\nAmir: [laughs] Yes I do.\n\nJake: But, OK.\n\nAmir: Ok\n\nJake: Ok\n\nAmir: It is Ok because it does save time.\n\nJake: It doesn't save time.\n\nAmir: [Singing and pretending to play an instrument] It is ok because it does save time, It is ok because it does save time.\n\nJake: [Joins in the song] Boop boop bedoop, It doesn't save time.\n\nAmir: [Still singing and playing] Yes it does, Yes it does.\n\nJake: [Stops singing] Well, whatever. That's a bad song anyway. Ok.\n\nAmir: [Still singing] Yes it does it does save time, yes it does it does save time. [gets louder] Yes it does it does save TIME!\n\nJake: [leaps across the desks onto Amir] I'm going to kill you!\n\nAmir: AHHH\n\nJake: [Yelling at and choking Amir] HOW IS IT A TIME SAVER? YOU'RE STILL WIPING, YOU'RE STILL SHITTING. YOU'RE STILL DOING BOTH THINGS.\n\nAmir: I can't breathe!\n\nJake: EXPLAIN IT TO ME. EXPLAIN IT.\n\nAmir: LET GO! All I'm saying is that if you wipe before you shit there's not a lot of shit there so you don't have to wipe as much! That's it! It's a time saver!\n\nJake: That's it? \n\nAmir: That's it, yeah.\n\nJake: That's really unsanitary. But I can see how you might say that's a time saver.\n\nAmir: Because it saves time.\n\nJake: It still doesn't make any sense but, I can see your logic.\n\nAmir: [nodding] What doesn't make sense?\n\nJake: I'll kill you.\n\nAmir: GAHHH\n\n", "duration": "2:20", "air_date": "2010-04-29", "scribe": "SirCuss", "_type": "episode"}

It's inter-league play, at Yankee Stadium, it's pretty cool.\n\nAMIR: (laughs) Not quite at Yankee Stadium, the game is in Cincinnati. \n\nJAKE: All right, pull over.\n\nAMIR: Da-nati. \n\nJAKE: Pull over, man.\n\nAMIR: The nati, shasta macnati. What's up?\n\nJAKE: I said pull over, all right? I don't want to go to Cincinnati. \n\nAMIR: We're almost there, relax! \n\nJAKE: We are not almost there, we just left, OK? And the game is in two hours, we're going to miss it.\n\nAMIR: We're not - (sighs). The game is not in two hours, check the date, it's in 26 hours, idiot. OK, so we're barely going to miss it.\n\nJAKE: But we're still missing the game. \n\nAMIR: Yeah, a little bit, but what's the big deal when you got (high pitched) the Overbeck Pottery Museum! \n\nJAKE: Doesn't sound like it's in Cincinnati, it sounds like it's in Overbeck. \n\nAMIR: Yeah, well you're wrong, again, because it's not in either; it's in Cambridge City, Indiana, which sounds far away but it's actually only a six hour drive from Cincinnati, which means road trip #2!\n\nJAKE: OK, well I don't want to go on road trip number one, so just please pull over. \n\nAMIR: That's fine. You're just being a little bit of a buzz kill right now but what you need is a high level of the tickle monster! (lets go of wheel to try and tickle Jake)\n\nJAKE: OK, pull--Watch the road! Watch the road!\n\nAMIR: (grabs wheel again) Oh my god! \n\nJAKE:  Geez! You're going to kill both of us.  You're going to kill us.  Let me drive. \n\nAMIR: N-n-n-n-no. I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to get me to let go of the steering wheel. It's not  gonna happen, OK? I don't trust you. \n\nJAKE: (sighs) I know a short cut. \n\nAMIR: Do you? OK, let's stop right here then. \n\n(they pull into a parking lot and Amir gets out to walk around the van while Jake slides over inside)\n\nAMIR: (while walking around to other side) But I hope you realize that this move, this little switch, makes me the DJ of this party-mobile. That's right, all party tunes, all the time. Me and you, haha, OK, uh...\n\n(Jake pulls away while Amir is trying at the locked passenger door) \n\nAMIR: (on cell leaving voicemail) J.K., it's me, uh, (chuckles) you're an idiot. Look to your right, man.  You are going to realize that I am not there. (chuckles again)\n\n(cut)\n\nMom, it's me, yeah, uh, I'm kind of stranded.\n\n(cuts back to leaving a voicemail)\n\nJake, you are going to be such an idiot when you look and realize I'm not there anymore.  Come back, all right? Or call me, buh-bye. (tries calling again) Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. J.K. It's me, uh . . . \n\nTHE END.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVvBC7RXPJ0\n\n", "duration": "2:13", "air_date": "2010-05-27", "scribe": "PBdolphin23", "_type": "episode"}

I actually don't want you to explain anything else because I do not want to be involved in whatever you-\n\nAMIR: 300 kids in 213 neighborhoods. All over the city. Plus! A little upstate New York. I even got one in Allentown, PA workin' for me! Dude's a little shit though. Met him on Facebook.\n\nJAKE: How'd you meet the other ones?\n\nAMIR: Facebook. But they all weren't little shits about it.\n\nJAKE: Got it.\n\nAMIR: Jake. These kids are bringin' home 2 pillow cases full of candy, min. I skim 10% off the top and pay them double face for each piece. (Laugh)\n\nJAKE: So you're paying them?\n\nAMIR: Oh, out of the nose man. I'm like Willy Wonka, baby. Chomp Chomp, bitch.\n\nJAKE: Willy Wonka never said that. Why would you pay them for candy bars?\n\nAMIR: Dude it's ridiculous. I ended up owing a kid over $800 last year for a frickin' York Peppermint Patty.  I don't know.\n\nJAKE: How is that two times face?\n\nAMIR: That one got away from me. I'll admit it. It was a slippery slope there, so.\n\nJAKE: Okay, well you know that: A) You can buy your own candy at the store and B-\n\nAMIR: All right. Stop right there! Okay, because I'm not doing this for the candy, all right.\n\nJAKE: So why are you paying kids literally hundreds of dollars-\n\nAMIR: Thousands of dollars.\n\nJAKE: Thousands of dollars!\n\nAMIR: Can you just shut up one second?! I'm on Facebook Chat with this little twerp from Allentown. Now he's telling me that I have to pay for my own train ticket out there. Okay, so, how do I get back? Do I ask his dad for a ride? Clearly not because his dad's already pissed at me for talking to the 13-year-old while he's at school.\n\nJAKE: Why are you wearing a dress?\n\nAMIR: Okay, all right, all right. How long have you been sitting on that question, Hurwitz? What else?\n\nJAKE: I'm serious. It's Thursday, it's not Halloween. There's no Halloween-\n\nAMIR: Laundry Day. Okay?\n\nJAKE: So you had no other clean clothes?\n\nAMIR: No! What? No! Laundry Day is when I steal shit from Laundromats. You think I bought this dress? No! I'm like Willy Freakin' Wonka.\n\nJAKE: You don't know who Willy Wonka is.\n\nAMIR: Chomp. Chomp.\n\nJAKE: Who's washing a fireman's helmet?\n\nAMIR: You gotta promise not to tell on me, man.\n\nTHE END\n\n", "duration": "1:52", "air_date": "2010-10-28", "scribe": "iamashleydef", "_type": "episode"}

Just, ughh... [talking to himself] So, if I eat it and two days later I take a crap and it goes in the toilet, he doesn't complain about that. But if I put it in the garbage now, then it's a bigger deal. I don't understand what the difference is. It's not his. It's gone. But he just latches on. He latches on and I can't let it get to me. I just have to let it go-- IT'S A FRICKIN' KIT KAT BAR, MAN! It's 99 cents! What do you want?! A quarter? You want a quarter for it, you're going to be that petty? Just forget it, man! Just pretend that I dropped it on the ground and I didn't want to eat it -- does that make you sleep at night?\n\nJake: Why don't we just move on?\n\nAmir: Well, I'm not going to let you sit here and sulk about it, okay?

I'm sorry.\n\nJake: Whatever.\n\nAmir: I mean, when I was six I had a wish, too. I had a wish that everybody I knew would be dead. How's that for a wish?\n\nJake: I don't know -- selfish?\n\nAmir: Bet you wish that one didn't come true.\n\nJake: Yeah.\n\nAmir: You know, if you're gonna be a bitch about it, then here: [tossing Jake an unwrapped Kit Kat bar] A full Kit Kat bar. Enjoy that, ya bitch!\n\nJake: So why'd you want one of mine?\n\nAmir: Okay, you know what? Here! [throwing more unwrapped Kit Kats at Jake] Take the whole lot! Jakey gets all the Kit Kats. Enjoy them, ya bitch!\n\nJake: Why do you have these?\n\nAmir: Because I buy two or three a day and I save one, okay? But I bet you knew that already, didn't you, bitch?\n\nJake: I clearly didn't.\n\nAmir: Alright, you know what? Here's an idea: We go bar for bar -- see who can eat the most candy.\n\nJake: You just said you were watching your weight.\n\nAmir: Yeah!

That was one of the suggest-\n\nAmir - Yeah you're right, I'll stick it out.\n\nJake - Didn't say that.\n\nAmir - Whoa, what's that?

I'm not an idiot, okay, so I think the thing's gonna crack but my eyes widen with fear when the bitch explodes in my mouth. I'm talking razor-sharp glass shards just cutting my mouth up from uvula to incisor, there was blood everywhere. Alright, next thing I know I'm in the back of Donnie's Camaro, he's the best man, and people are just begging me not to fall asleep. I'm laughing maniacally, my face is like a blood-sprinkler, the red liquid's just shooting everywhere, getting on the interior and stuff. To make matters worse I wasn't even invited to the frickin' thing. So I start passing out, you know, Nature's Promise and all.\n\nJAKE: That's a butter company.\n\nAMIR: I wake up in post-op four hours later and I needed 31 stitches to close me shut, nurse is livid, just crying in the corner because I've been shitting myself nonstop which sounds standard, but it's not.\n\nJAKE: Doesn't sound standard.\n\nAMIR: They choose this golden moment to give me a hospital bill. Uh-oh, daddy doesn't have health insurance. So I book it, alright. Cut to interior, hospital, day, later, I am barreling skull-first into a doctor, right into his chest, and he gets plowed to the floor. Medical equipment everywhere, alright. The beeper falls onto the ground and I just jump on it like a Nazi taking a grenade for his German cohorts. He looks passed out, but I'm not gonna take that risk, okay, so I shove the beeper three inches into my butt and I just take off in a dead sprint due north, remember that direction 'cause it's gonna come in handy later. I'm three towns over before I even realize nobody's chasing me and at that point I'm thanking God because my groin is torn to shreds.\n\nJAKE: So that beeper was in your butt?\n\nAMIR: For 14 miles. And the bitch still works. (winks)\n\nTHE END\n\n", "duration": "3:08", "air_date": "2011-02-03", "scribe": "tottle321", "_type": "episode"}

I just got this e-mail that you sent to the entire company and, um, nobody's going to believe you're doing a triathlon for charity.\n\nAmir: Ooh, this kitten's got claws.

He he. ...Why not?\n\nJake: For starters, you began the e-mail by saying Dear Suckers.\n\nAmir: Yea, as in deer suckers. Like little possums.\n\nJake: So, that makes even less sense than I originally thought. Secondly, triathlons are running, swimming and biking, not drinking, fucking and stealing ya'lls cash.\n\nAmir: Cash money, ain't nothin funny.\n\nJake: That's not a response to what I just said.\n\nAmir: Fo'sho!\n\nJake: Look, even if they get past the beginning of this e-mail, the next part is a picture of you in a jewelry store, holding a diamond watch, with the caption: I want dis.\n\nAmir: You don't understand, man. I want dis.\n\nJake: That's the only thing I understand.\n\nAmir: Ok! If you don't want to make the donation just put in like $150 and then click send.

I legit want/need dis watch. Blew your cover there. Then, three follow up e-mails that say: Please disregard, please disregard, please disregard. One more, though. Just one sentence long and it says: Come on, douches. Help out the cause. And it's a photo shopped picture of you shitting on Bill Cosby.\n\nAmir: That was a Jello pudding snack.\n\nJake: That was a Jello pudding snack, ok. It's kinda weird, though, that you have a legit picture of you taking a shit.\n\nAmir: Yea, the Cos loves his Jello pudding sweaters.\n\nJake: Final e-mail: Please recall all e-mails. Somebody's being a bitch. And it's a photo shopped picture of Bill Cosby shitting on me, which is extra weird because you somehow got a photo of Bill Cosby taking a shit?\n\nAmir: The Cos has to poop, eventually, sir. And it's just about finding the right f...\n\nJake: How are you so fast at photo shop?\n\nAmir: It's all about doing it real crudely and quickly.\n\nJake: Not very crudely. They're fine lines.\n\nAmir: Yea, the trick is to make it look like it's very good, but it's actually not that good.\n\nJake: You gotta stop it with that impression.\n\nAmir: Yea, well at least I don't spit when I talk!\n\nJake: Do I do that?\n\nAmir: No!

Let me tell you something about myself, my friend: I do not cut corners. This is how I do it, yes on the glass studio, throw in an oven. Okay, if I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this, then I can't start cutting corners on an oven Mickey. laughs The cheque? The cheque- I just handed the cheque off to the postman right now.

The first one ended up insanely well but there's no way in hell she's ever going to go out with me again.  Two of the girls I gave pink eye to.

I want one thing, and one thing only. A one night stand. Only at the end of the night, we won't be standing. I want to lay down and hug you. \n\nJAKE: That's sad.  Tell me about where you grew up. \n\nAMIR: A lot of girls don't like guys that kiss and tell. Well, let me be frank with you, yet again, sweetheart. I never kiss, and always tell.

It's kind of a miracle the other 3 dates didn't get it.   \n\nAMIR: Yeah, well they probably did. \n\nJAKE: All right, well like I said, I don't know anyone who would want to go out with you. \n\nAMIR: Sorry.

And I can't imagine one of them that you didn't break.\n\nAMIR: Just try to focus all your energy, like a laser, on one thing, yeah.\n\nJAKE: Stop saying like you want one thing, like you only could've made one mistake. You made a lot of mistakes.\n\nAMIR: Focus it. Focus in on one.\n\nJAKE: Okay, the first mistake you could've made: your title is F*ck It: I'm Going Fishing Instead.\n\nAMIR: Wow! Congrats, grad! You can read.\n\nJAKE: Don't get defensive so early, okay? I mean, I read the whole thing, didn't I?

It comes on page 299, and I think it's a typo because the main character says, Interior: I don't give a flaming fuck.\n\nAMIR: You should've heard Mr. Nort deliver that line. He nailed it in callbacks.\n\nJAKE: Okay, how about this: I'll shred the entire thing and as a favor to you, I will never bring it up again.\n\nAMIR: So basically, you're jealous 'cause we didn't cast you as the main guy.\n\nJAKE: Okay, I'm not jealous, alright? I don't give a shit.\n\nAMIR: You're not annoyed we went with Nort over you?\n\nJAKE: I would've loved at least an opportunity to make callbacks, to know I was seriously considered.\n\nAMIR: You were seriously considered. You were!\n\nJAKE: Oh, bullshit!\n\nAMIR: Yes!\n\nJAKE: You dragged my ass in there as a dog and pony show, alright?

Ok, you're starting to freak me out. Do you remember like five minutes ago you tied up Jake and locked him in the supply closet?

Or two (points to egg box), break in there and get me all the eggs in the world.\n\nAmir: Ok you're the one who told me to bet on all those NBA games, man, remember!? And then you're like oh the NBA's locked out this season (Rick Fox plays the world's smallest violin), so all those bets are an instant loss!\n\nRick Fox: Yeah, instant loss.\n\nAmir: By the way, there might not be any eggs in here, ok; let alone, I think you said, all the eggs in the world. So. Just trying to temper your expectations, ya know?

Oh, okay. Turn my mic up, actually. Can you turn my mic up? I spent, like, a bad amount of money for this recording session, and my mic isn't even up!\n\nJAKE: So this is the album.\n\nAMIR: (turns album off) Good question. It's called Chillin' in the Streets: the Night Diary of Amir Valerie Blumenfeld, a Jake Hurwitz Production.\n\nJAKE: Awesome. Take my name off the title.\n\nAMIR: Oh, now you give a shit!

Please read now and delete your account.\n\nAmir: He started. He started charging, seven bucks a pop.\n\nJake: No he didn't!\n\nAmir: He didn't, because enough people joined the group!\n\nJake: You just lied, then, cause you said he did start charging.\n\nAmir: Oh my god, the facts are in on Twitter: Facebook was perfect but they just made it Myspace!

You just said it was perfect. The same version you hated two years ago, you just called it perfect.\n\nAmir: Garbage becomes perfect over time as you get used to the garbage and forget what made it so bad. Like, you don't get the Internet and commenting in general, so it's not even worth saying—\n\nJake: By the way, have you been to Myspace recently? It's just a music video website. There's no profiles or anything.\n\nAmir: Yeah, you know why?\n\nJake: Cause they jumped the shark—\n\nAmir: Cause they jumped the car—the, yeah—the shark, exactly right.\n\nOriginal Location\n\nSpare me your change.\n\n", "duration": "2:52", "air_date": "2011-12-27", "scribe": "spyman510", "_type": "episode"}

Tried.  Turns out he didn't have to go and the only thing he could muster was a little bit of pee and a shart roughly the size of a dead tadpole.  Looked like a mud-covered slug and stank like a pug.  So I flip on the old windshield wipers, throw the Sorento into drive and crash through my parents garage.  Flip a U-bang and I start humming to myself ♪Silent Night♪.  Only problem is I'm sad as hell.\n\nJake: Yeah, I would be too.\n\nAmir: But I figure hey, 'tis the season who doesn't love a second chance so I swing by the mall and buy my dad a two thousand dollar watch.  Yeah, a gold roly-poly for that oldy-trolly.\n\nJake: Oh no...\n\nAmir: Oh no is...wrong!  Yeah, turns out gold isn't his color because when I get home the entire house is gutted, empty, and there's a note on what's left of the door that says here died a happy family, RIP, thanks to you, Amir.  Can you believe that?  Callin' me out like that?  Rawdoggin' me in front of my girl.\n\nJake: So oh no was right, by the way, and, what girl?\n\nAmir: Oh that's another thing.  I brought home a Thai whore just to show my dad that I had a mate in life.\n\nJake: Why do you want his affection?  It sounds like he's a terrible person.\n\nAmir: He means well.\n\nJake: No, he doesn't.  How could he possibly mean well?\n\nAmir: How's this for a happy ending?  New Years Eve Eve, December 39th.\n\nJake: Wrong.\n\nAmir: I get a call from a jail in Fresno saying that they locked my old man up and threw away the key.  I'm alone, not doing anything anyway so I toss on a wig and hoof it down to the 'No to bail his ass out.

Guys, everyone throw up your bagels right now.  Throw them up or start paying me for them.\n\nJake: You can't do that.\n\nAmir: Guess what? Everyone owes me two bucks now because Jake's doggin' me.

Ok?\n\nJake: I hate that you can put those on so quickly.\n\nAmir: I spend a penny to make two. Do you know what it's like to grow up on the street? To be hood? Or would you rather just suck off Uncle Sam and swallow what he gives ya? By the way, that was my dream last night.\n\nJake: You have a job. You could make so much more money doing a good job here, in the office. Did you really blow Uncle Sam in your dream last night?\n\nAmir [no longer wearing sunglasses]: I could clear five dollars easy street if all y'all just ponied up six dollars apiece for these Ed Bagley juniors!

What are you talking about? Suck my dick, okay, I ponied up the dough!\n\nJAKE: No you didn't! Let's look back just last year. You were mathematically eliminated after the first day. You begged Johnson Hussey for your money back, when he finally gave it to you, you said, Keep the change you filthy animal. I'ma buy back in at a G. You submitted what turned out to be a perfect bracket and a thousand dollars in cash--\n\nAMIR: (quietly, doodling): Thank you.\n\nJAKE: Then you showed up, rolling on E to our office party for the finals. You shredded the money, tore up your bracket and pissed on Sunusi's phone. You screamed, All contracts are null and Lloyd!

Number one says wiping. \n\nAMIR: Yes.\n\nJAKE: That shouldn't be that hard.\n\nAMIR: And yet it is.\n\nJAKE: No it's not.\n\nAMIR: Ok.\n\nJAKE: (holds up iPad) Sorry, just look at your iPad, right? It's covered in cracks and barbecue sauce. \n\nAMIR: I was trying to change the battery on this piece of junk.\n\nJAKE: You haven't tried to clean it! Ok, treat your stuff better!\n\nJAKE: Number two on your list of shit that's hard to deal with is not shaking foreigners and demanding they speak English. Awful.\n\nAMIR: That's an example of something I do all the time.\n\nJAKE: I know.\n\nAMIR: The hardest thing anyone has to deal with, emotionally, is finding out that a loved one doesn't feel anything for them anymore.\n\nJAKE: What's the app?\n\nAMIR: I'm not always talking about apps.\n\nAMIR: So, you hate the Papua New Guinean community, I hate the Papua New Guinean community. So let's just agree-\n\nJAKE: Stop, I don't hate the Papua New Guinean community. \n\nAMIR: Ok. So this app might be a dud. (snorts)\n\nAMIR: This one's pretty slick, actually, it's an app called burger and you use it when you're hungry.\n\nJAKE: How?\n\nAMIR: It's a picture of a burger and, uh, ya eat your iPad. (chuckles)\n\nJAKE: Cool, so that's why you have the, uh-\n\nAMIR: Barbecue sauce everywhere, no, that was for a different app called ribs and it's not what it sounds like. That was a picture of-\n\nJAKE: Ribs.\n\nAMIR: Exactly right, how did you-\n\nJAKE: How is that not what it sounds like?\n\nAMIR: You're getting defensive.\n\nJAKE: Oh my-\n\nAMIR: It's called Photobooth and you can use it to take goofy pictures of yourselves.\n\nJAKE: That app has been around for a while.\n\nAMIR: Yeah, well I created a lens for it, called fisheye.\n\nJAKE: I feel so bad for you, man.\n\nAMIR: If you're gonna call me out on every single white lie I tell, just, just leave, I'm serious man.\n\nJAKE: Fine. (gets up)\n\nAMIR: Bahh! When I'm done!\n\nJAKE: What is that noise?\n\nAMIR: What noise?\n\nJAKE: It just comes out of your mouth when I go to leave. (gets up)\n\nAMIR: I guess so- Bahh!\n\nAMIR: You're in a bad place right now and I feel like even if I pitched you a good idea you wouldn't be into it.\n\nJAKE: You haven't pitched me a good idea so don't worry about that, right?\n\nAMIR: (taps iPad) Alright.\n\nJAKE: Actually you know what? (takes iPad) I'm gonna take away the iPad. Because it costs a lot of money and you don't know how to take care of it. Sorry.\n\nAMIR: Oh my God, I have a case for it, relax.\n\nJAKE: The case has more barbecue sauce on it than the iPad.\n\nAMIR: Call me out. Call me out in front of all your big friends so that I can feel small. \n\nJAKE: Don't talk to me like a bitter boyfriend or something.\n\nAMIR: Don't compartmentalize me like I'm a chore. \n\nJAKE: You spit all over my fucking arm just now.\n\nAMIR: (huggine Jake) I hate when we fight like this.\n\nJAKE: Stop!\n\nAMIR: Alright, so this one's a hoot and a half. (laughs briefly) What's the hardest part about reading?\n\nJAKE: Finding the time.\n\nAMIR: Ok, never mind.\n\nJAKE: Your app idea just says the vowels.\n\nAMIR: Never mind, I said!\n\nAMIR: You try to put everything in a box. And if it doesn't fit, ya throw it away. (pause, reaches for hug) I'm sorry.\n\nJAKE: Get-\n\nAMIR: So you know how Instagram sold for (puts pinky to lip) one billion dollars?\n\nJAKE: Don't do that.\n\nAMIR: (laughs) So this would be an app that harasses the creators of Instagram until they give us a few million dollars to stop.\n\nJAKE: Alright, don't take this as a compliment.\n\nAMIR: Thank you.\n\nJAKE: That's your best app idea yet.\n\nAMIR: Appreciate it.\n\nJAKE: It's still terrible.\n\nAMIR: Danke.\n\nJAKE: It's just all your other ideas are so bad.\n\nAMIR: Gracias. (laughs)\n\nJAKE: Ok, don't take this-\n\nAMIR: Todah rabah. \n\nJAKE: Fuck you!\n\n(pause, Amir recoils)\n\nAMIR: (whispers) Ouch.\n\nJAKE: Hey, brace yourself 'cause this is not gonna be pleasant.\n\nAMIR: Oh no, constructive criticism!\n\nJAKE: Quit. \n\nAMIR: (faintly) Ow.\n\nJAKE: Not even quit while you're ahead, quit while you're behind. None of these ideas were good. I would feel bad telling you to go back to the drawing board. \n\nAMIR: Right, yeah, yeah.\n\nJAKE: I feel like there's not even a single nugget of an idea that's worth exploring.\n\nAMIR: That's fine, Ok.\n\nJAKE: Furthermore,\n\nAMIR: Oh?\n\nJAKE: You're not smart.\n\nAMIR: No.\n\nJAKE: You're not getting better.\n\nAMIR: Nope.\n\nJAKE: You don't have a mind that's capable of improving itself. You can't even take care of this iPad. So I say, let's toss out the iPad. We'll, we'll find something else for you to do, you know?\n\nAMIR: Yeah.\n\nJAKE: With your time.\n\nAMIR: At least I gave it the old college try, you know?\n\nJAKE: I'm not sure you did.\n\nAMIR: Well, at least I tried my best, you know? (snorts)\n\nJAKE: That is sad, because it wasn't even close to being good enough.\n\nAMIR: (tapping couch) Absolutely (snorts) I just, uh. Quit it, alright, you're making me feel weak.\n\nJAKE: You are weak.\n\nAMIR: (raising voice) Enough! Ok, you're not creative!\n\nTHE END\n\n", "duration": "3:34", "air_date": "2012-07-03", "scribe": "tottle321", "_type": "episode"}

I'm not gonna be your roommate Mickey. I live in a god damn trash heap and your rent was too damn high. Your mom's bringing us iced tea in mason jars?  Well that doesn't sound like my dream! That doesn't sound like my idea of a good time Mickey. Hold on, I'm getting another call.\n\nJake: Make your phone calls in the conference room from now on.\n\nAmir: Oscar the Grouch speaking.

He raw-dogged us, he did-- you're blinking a lot--\n\nAMIR: Yeah, he raw-dogged me, h-- I feel like he bent me over a table and dogged me raw or something. He raw-dogged me! Yeah.\n\nMURPH: That's exactly what he did. He just took us and he just fuckin' took his dry-ass little dick and he just shoved it in our raw buttholes.\n\nAMIR: Yeah, and he did it raw! That's the worst part. I feel like if he lubed me up-- okay, fine. That's one thing. Whatever. Moist: it slides right in-- Yeah! Just spit.

This is the most pinteresting thing I've seen all week.

Yo, that kale smoothie looks dope.\n\nJAKE: Are we still on a date? Is this even still a date? Because I'd feel like I was missing out if Neko had said anything to me, ever! Neko! ...Neko! Come on.\n\nAMIR: All right! So, this is a most interesting little dish; it's sort of a palate-cleanser in terms that it's a spinach hazelnut salad with onions, olives, and a citrus balsamic vinaigrette.\n\n[As Amir describes the salad, Emily smiles slyly and runs her foot up Jake's leg under the table.

That's right, go to wine country - Napa Valley, California together. \n\nJake: Great! \n\n[While Jake is talking, Amir plays peekaboo behind the scroll]\n\nJake: So on your first date you want to take a cross-country drive with a stranger and then spend several days in wine country with them? That's like a nine day excursion buddy- \n\n[Amir still peeks from behind the scroll, this time wearing sunglasses]\n\nJake: Stop doing that!\n\nAmir: Number 8: Take your mother on a date. The first chick you were inside of and you didn't even call her. Now that's baller. \n\nJake: That's disgusting \n\nAmir: Lucky number sleven: change your name to Kevin! \n\nJake: Weird. Not a date\n\nAmir: Meet her in heaven. That's right a Romeo and Juliet group suicide so you could spend all of eternity together. \n\nJake: Why do you write everything on these scrolls? Like these ancient treasure maps you seem to have? \n\nAmir: Six: stands for chicks. That's right, it's the year 2000, so wherever she wants to go you make it happen, Cap'n. \n\nJake: That is the second time you've: 1) gotten the year wrong, and 2) avoided choosing a date spot \n\nAmir: High five: smoke a bowl and roll. Wake and bake and make her make you a steak. You're ingesting weed and ecstasy, and guess what day it is... X-mas eve.\n\nJake: Have you done that before? \n\nAmir: Yes! Number 4 is a city so nice they named it Rice. Rice, Texas. \n\nJake: Another road trip?\n\nAmir: You actually fly in through Dallas! It's a hub!\n\nJake: Fine.\n\nAmir: Number 3: will you marry me? \n\nJake: Too much, too fast, way too soon! \n\nAmir: I don't need an answer tonight, but I do need a promise in writing that you'll love me forever. \n\nJake: That's more than an answer. That's a contract. \n\nAmir: All marriages are arranged, if you include destiny. \n\nJake: I don't \n\nAmir: Number 2: Darlin' it's always been you. Please say I do, I have a rabbi a priest and a mosque on standby. \n\nJake: That last one is not a person.

Why do you stay up at night in your apartment making these weird lists? And you know what, even if you get some kind of perverse pleasure out of writing the lists, why bring them to work, and read them to me, when I don't like it? \n\nAmir: Great, so a simple yes or no would have sufficed. \n\nJake: It actually wouldn't have sufficed, because you said: Thought's on the list? That's not a yes or no question\n\nAmir: And? What are your thoughts on the list? \n\nJake: It's a bad list. It's a bad list and you're a bad person. \n\nAmir: Wow! That was scoff unexpected...

Go on.\n\nAmir: I figured if I doused myself in hot soup, you'd want to bring me in. Show me some tender love and care, y'know? Maybe rent some DVDs from Blockbuster Media.

I was starting this phone tree, you know, trying to alert every member of my family as to what happened.\n\nJAKE: You have got to be SHITTING me with that, dude!  You were on your phone? You were on your phone??  And you were ignoring my texts as they're coming in??  By the way, a phone tree works like this: You call one person, then that person calls another person and then that person calls another person.  Doesn't mean, like, everybody's calling you, making it so you can't respond to your texts, right?  It's some kind of reverse phone tree?  Were you the trunk?  If you're the trunk, then you got punked.\n\nAMIR: I don't know what to say.  I guess I got punked.  It's just that I'm also in emotional pain, too, right now, man.\n\nJAKE:  Don't play that card, you coward.  Okay, I sent you 12 pictures of myself in a dressing room, and it would've taken 3 seconds out of your day to give me a hell to the no.

As in starting now, and seeing as though I texted you yesterday, Lucy! You got some 'splaining to do!  (to the office) If anybody heard that and didn't laugh, I urge you to reconsider.  Okay, I would take a pity laugh to save some face.  Speaking of face, why is nobody sucking on my face as I am looking amazing in these ill-fitting - slim-fitting! - cords?\n\nAMIR: I thought you said you didn't like the pants.\n\nJAKE: You thought wrong.

If the taste is heinous, shove it up your anus! you'll get drunk better, faster, stronger.\n\nJake: That is what you did last night at my new year's party, but do you think you were drunker better than anybody? because I think you should up blackout drunk at seven P.M., in half a tuxedo, just the top half, you were naked waist down. You had a glass champagne flute stuck inside your butt, and you were dancing around singing \"happy new queer\".\n\nAmir: Number nine, that's wine and dine! A Chardonnay and a fish fillet, blend it up, dinner and a drink, now that won't stink.\n\nJake: You're talking about shoving blended fish inside your butt, then yeah I bet it does.\n\nAmir: To each, her own.\n\nNumber eight, it must be fate. A Zinfandel for this infidel make me think, don't ask, do tell. I stick a funnel in my butt.\n\nJake: We all know what you do, ok? You ruined New Year's. When everybody was counting down you bent over and farted Vodka onto the TV.\n\nAmir: I'm the life and death, of every party.\n\nJake: Yeah you definitely killed the mood when you slipped and fell and shattered that glass Champagne flute inside your body. We took you to the hospital but the doctor refused to operate on you. He said, in the long run it might be better if you just die.\n\nAmir: Number seven, is Levant. That's right, I soak a full body bread in a Jewish rye bread, and this ass, gets fed. Aka, you freeze the loaf and chisel off little suppositories that you stick inside your ass all night like little Tic-Tacs.\n\nJake: Is that what you do with Tic-Tacs?\n\nAmir: Yeah!\n\nJake: Why?\n\nAmir: Number six, it's for dicks! Take a Capri-Sun straw and stick it in your urethra. With a reverse piss, you can't miss.\n\nJake: So you graduated to dick chugging?\n\nAmir: With honors, sir.\n\nAmir: Number five, P. nomwar? More like p. yes. - Lar.\n\nJake: Woah.\n\nAmir: Woah\n\nJake: Bad.\n\nAmir [disappointed]: Oh.\n\nJake: Terrible rhyme.\n\nAmir: No?\n\nJake: How did that make your final draft?\n\nAmir: It didn't.\n\nJake: This isn't a final? Why are you reading it in front of me?\n\nAmir: Number four. One Tequila, two Tequila, three Tequila, sore. Ow, if your anus ain't bruised all night, then you ain't funnelin' right.\n\nJake: Is there a right way to funnel? If there is, I bet you don't know it. 'Cause why else do you have those shards of glass inside your anal cavity right now?\n\nAmir: Number three, you and me. Sippin' on some English tea.\n\nJake: So not butt chugging.\n\nAmir: Oh, no, no, no. We're sipping it through our assholes.\n\nJake: Definitely not doing that with you.\n\nAmir: Number two, how about some Yoo-hoo where you poo-poo. That's right, it's already wet and brown downtown, mamma mia, that's some diarrhea!\n\nJake: I think what I'm gonna do is e-mail Paul...\n\nAmir: No.\n\nJake: ...and ugh, see if I have the permission to send you home, or if he will. Um, you need to not be here today.\n\nAmir: How is that your call to make?\n\nJake: I'm gonna tell him the circumstances and see if I can send you home.\n\nAmir: That's so illogical to me.\n\nJake: Really?\n\nAmir: Yeah.\n\nJake: That's illogical? 'Cause I think getting your anus wounds untreated, leaving the hospital saying: \"Fuck this quack, you're a hack\", I think that's illogical.\n\nAmir: Not fair.\n\nJake: That's not fair? What you're doing to your body isn't fair.\n\nAmir: I'm almost done with the list.\n\nJake: Three of your top ten haven't even been alcohol. One of them involved shoving a straw inside your dick. I mean that's self-mutilation bud, and I think all of them will kill you.\n\nAmir: Number one, have some fun in the sun hun. Bring your ass to the beach, and flop it down like a leech. Put your knees by your ears, but don't feed your butt beers. Not Vodka nor Gin, no those can't go in. Spread your butt cheeks wide, stick that funnel inside, now wait for the tide you're going for a ride. You're a full grown guy, with a tight brown eye, so make sure your lips are sealed, and your rectum is peeled. Which alcohol is best, for your asshole that stretch? Not red nor white, nor Captain Morgan's Delight, no. What will save the day? Oh you don't say? it's: drum roll please.\n\nJake: No.\n\nAmir: A simple Rose.\n\n[Jake start clapping slowly]\n\nAmir: Thank you.\n\nJake: I don't mean it. Are you done with the list?\n\nAmir: Not 'till I celebrate, [takes out a glass of blended fish and alcohol, and a funnel], with a number nine.\n\nJake: Please not now, not here at the office.\n\n[Amir starts pouring the drink into the funnel, and looks in pain].\n\nJake: Oh no!

Correction: was my biggest weakness is?\n\nJake: You're not smart?\n\nAmir: No.\n\nJake: You get angry easily?\n\nAmir: No exercise gear, exactly right.\n\nJake: You also seem incapable of going with the flow of a conversation.  You have like some sort of agenda, you're going to make your point no matter what I contribute.\n\nAmir: No arm warmer.  No tank.  A lack of zero compression pants.\n\nJake: You had a lack of zero compression pants?\n\nAmir: I went to Sports Authority, and I got calm.\n\n[brief pause]\n\nJake: What?\n\nAmir: My life has been a whirlwind ever since Passover. Yeah, my dad gave me a hundred dollar bill to go fuck myself with.  Luckily for me, they accept that at most sporting goods stores. [hits ground while doing a push-up] Ow.\n\nJake: If it's a hundred dollar bill, then they accept it anywhere.\n\nAmir [eating from a gel pouch]: Ugh, these things never get any easier to swallow.  Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo!\n\nJake: Have you actually started exercising?\n\nAmir: Not yet, I'm a triathlete.  As in, I'm trying to be an athlete.\n\nJake: By buying those clothes?\n\nAmir [doing the macarena]: They say to dress for the job you want.  And I want a blow job.\n\nJake: You know, that's not even a stretch, that's the macarena.  You can leave, or you can get to work.\n\nAmir: I'm actually pretty depressed about all this shit.  I feel like I can't get my act together at all.\n\nJake:  Cool, man, I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you want me to say?\n\nAmir: I spent the better part of a G of not my own money trying to make my old man proud.  Turns out the only thing he could be proud of, is that his son is a piece of shit.\n\nJake: Why would he be proud of that?\n\nAmir: I like to make people laugh, you know?  Except the only problem is I'm the only joke in this room.  And what's so funny about a grown-ass loser?\n\nJake: I guess it's funny that you're having this realization in compression pants.\n\nAmir: That's true. \n\nJake: No, man, I was making fun of you.\n\nAmir: Thanks, man.  I needed to hear that.\n\nJake: Don't thank me, I was being mean to you.\n\nAmir: Hey, everybody: get a load of these pants.\n\n[crowd which has suddenly materialized begins laughing]\n\nAmir: Oppa gangnam style!\n\n[everyone laughs harder]\n\n[Amir begins dancing and crowd starts to applaud and cheer]\n\n[Jake, smiling happily, claps twice and points a finger to the sky]\n\n[All Gold Everything by Trinidad James can be heard playing]\n\nAmir dressed as blonde woman [in Southern accent]: I want to give you the job you want: a blow job.\n\n[transition to Amir, semi-conscious and dancing, sitting up against some garbage cans on a sidewalk]\n\nAmir: Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo!\n\n[Jake and a Police Officer approach]\n\nJake: Yeah, that's him.\n\nPolice Officer: We found him passed out outside of a Sports Authority shouting obscenities at strangers.\n\nJake: Is he dead?\n\nPolice Officer: Unfortunately, no.

I don't wanna do this chore!'\"\n\nJAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?\n\nAMIR: \"Number three:\"\n\nJAKE: Holy shit...\n\nAMIR: \"...fireworks for me!

Sure, who wouldn't? And who wouldn't feel a little bit guilty after strangling a scared iguana? Obviously, animals can't... (laughs) talk! But this little guy was begging me with his eyes for mercy.

You said \"What's your return policy? Because if you think Jake will ever return this, it's a fallacy.\"\n\nAMIR: Yeah and you know what he did?\n\nJAKE: According to your script he \"cried tears of soy.\"\n\nAMIR: (simultaneously with Jake) CRIED TEARS OF SOY, yeah, exactly right!\n\nJAKE: That's not a real thing. That can't happen.\n\nAMIR: Really? Okay, here we go, 'cause look at this!

That Scooby-Doo pun? That destroyed at my pop-pop's wake.\n\nNICK-JAKE: Why did you tell it there?\n\nBRIAN-AMIR: Um, 'cause everyone was sad? Especially me! I was his closest friend! Open casket? Now I can't buy a basket.\n\nNICK-JAKE: Can you please try not to rhyme all of the time?\n\nBRIAN-AMIR: You just did it!\n\nNICK-JAKE: That was unintentional.\n\nBRIAN-AMIR: Oh, an unintentional rhyme? Well I'm an unconventional mime, [he moves his hands as if in an invisible box] eating an unpresentable lime.\n\n[Brian-Amir pantomimes taking a bite out of an invisible lime.]\n\nBRIAN-AMIR: Eww!-- Fuck you. Crack up at that.\n\nNICK-JAKE: Wh-- you didn't even give me time to laugh at that! You knew that would fail.\n\nBRIAN-AMIR: Fuck you, fuck you, I'm cool, and fuck you.\n\n[Brian-Amir begins laughing.]\n\nBRIAN-AMIR: Ohh! Oh, it hurts to laugh, it hurts to laugh...\n\n[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are Andrew and Evan Gregory of the Gregory Brothers.]\n\nEVAN-AMIR: ...And fuck you.\n\nANDREW-JAKE: I-- I think we should ask Sam if you can go home.\n\nEVAN-AMIR: Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?\n\nANDREW-JAKE: Yes, I would.\n\nEVAN-AMIR: Wow. The truth comes tumbling out. Jake's a frickin' anti-Semite. And that just ain't right.\n\nANDREW-JAKE: ...What?\n\n[Harp and transition. Jake and Amir are themselves; Amir seems to be talking in his sleep.]\n\nAMIR: I said \"You, Jacob Hurwitz... you're an anti-Semite.\"\n\n[Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew and Evan have gathered around Jake's chair.]\n\nNICK: What did he just say?\n\nJAKE: He's half-asleep, dude. What do you mean \"what did he just say\"? It doesn't matter.\n\nABBI: Oh, it doesn't matter because what? What, because he's a Jew?\n\n[Abbi shoves Jake.]\n\nJAKE: I didn't say that! What are you talking about?\n\nAMIR: [now very much awake] I'm talkin' about you hating Jew.\n\nILANA: You prick! I know many Jews.\n\nJAKE: So do I! I'm half Jewish--\n\n[Brian punches Jake in the face.]\n\nJAKE: Ow!\n\nBRIAN: I don't hit like a Jew, do I?\n\nJAKE: ...That was anti-Semitic, what you just said!\n\nAMIR: Get him!\n\nJAKE: What are you talking about--\n\n[Everybody begins beating up Jake.]\n\nJAKE: Hey! Ow! Ow, quit it--\n\n[Amir laughs maniacally.]\n\n[Harp and transition. Amir is lying on a couch, presumably dreaming the situation just shown. He is laughing in his sleep. Abbi, Ilana, Nick, Brian, Andrew, Evan and Jake are standing around him.]\n\nANDREW: I thought you said we were gonna shoot a video.\n\nJAKE: I'm sorry; I think he fell asleep, so...\n\nAMIR: [mumbling] Tear his... Jew-hating face off.\n\nEND", "duration": "2:47", "air_date": "2013-05-24", "scribe": "fwavoy", "_type": "episode"}

I'm gonna sue whoever put this clip in my throat!\n\nAMIR: Okay, it's called-- it's called a digital tip jar! For any online transaction you make, the tip jar forces you to round up to the nearest dollar and takes that excess change. It returns it to you at the end of the year so you feel like you're making free money! We make one percent off total transaction costs, which seems pretty negligible, but really starts to add up the more clients we get!\n\nJAKE: That's actually really smart--\n\nAMIR: That is a dummy idea I stole from my entrepreneur friend Clovis!

I don't wanna do this chore!'\"\n\nJAKE: So in some miraculous turn of events, [Amir mock-cries by blinking and quivering his lip] the judge actually accepts your bribe in this fantasy world, and the way you repay fate for giving you this awesome favor [Amir grins and nods] is by being too lazy to rake a yard?\n\nAMIR: \"Number three:\"\n\nJAKE: Holy shit...\n\nAMIR: \"...fireworks for me!

I feel like if you knew what that meant, the sixty-nine thing, you'd be cracking up.\n\nJAKE: I know what that is.\n\nAMIR: Not the number, ass. It's a sex thing. Okay, it's when a girl eats your butt. Sixty-nine.\n\nAMIR: You're poor. You're poor. Y'all are poor. And I'm a rich bitch.\n\nJAKE: You're a bitch?\n\nAMIR: I'm not a bitch. I'm rich.\n\nAMIR: How's your summer been?\n\nJAKE: Fine.\n\nAMIR: Fine. I knew you'd give a fricken' one word answer and I knew you'd say fine, and to prove it, I wrote it down on a piece of paper before I left my apartment this morning. Exhibit A!\n\nJAKE: This says \"Urinals are for pee-pee, toilets are for doo-doo.\"\n\nAMIR: Other side then.\n\nJAKE: It's a bunch of drafts of one liners. The last one being \"I'm the sixty-nine percent.\"\n\nAMIR: Wrong note then.\n\nJAKE: Yeah! Yeah it is, I can't believe you thought this said fine.\n\nAMIR: Wrong note I said!\n\nJAKE (At the same time Amir is speaking): There's so many words. You thought it said fine? You thought there was a chance-\n\nAMIR (At the same time Jake is speaking): You already embarrassed me. You already ashamed me.\n\nAMIR: Raise your hand if you think I have social issues!\n\nJAKE: You know, can you really not just sit still?\n\nJAKE: I told the officers you had a personality disorder, and they almost let us go but then you stole a billy club and hit a policeman in the shin with it. You said \"Score one for the Hurwitz brothers! If you don't like our power, take it from us with brute force.\" That's when we were both tased.\n\nAMIR: Why are you rehashing this shit? Alright, I was there.\n\nJAKE: I know you were there.\n\nAMIR: So you don't have to repeat it okay, just move on!\n\nJAKE: Ok, fine, I'm-\n\nAMIR: MOVE ON! MOVE ON! MOVE ON!

Out of the way, it's an A-list star!\n\nJAKE: You just rhymed \"star\" with \"star\"?\n\nAMIR: I'm just flustered because I'm around a frickin' celebutante! Yeah, Shia the frickin' Beef, in the flesh! You're looking at a quadruple-threat, motherfucker! [begins counting down on his fingers for emphasis] Film star! Movie star! TV star! And guess what?

You're sitting in the king's throne! Up, or off with your head!\n\nJAKE: This is my desk.\n\nMIKE: [pointing behind himself] I can sit over there...\n\nAMIR: No! Nonsense, sir! And I'm really sorry you have to see me like this, but please, Jake! Immediately! Get the fuck up! This is Shia the fuckin' Beef!\n\nJAKE: You know, I think you actually like when he sees you like this. I think you get off on it, 'cause you act this way every single time Mike Fink-- by the way, not Shia LaBeouf-- comes to the office.\n\nAMIR: \"Mike Fink\", right? \"John Doe\"? Okay? We don't have to use alii. We're friends here, and Shia, by the way, you're not foolin' anyone, okay? I can smell Megan Fox's naked box on your bated breath, and guess what? [imitates cunnilingus with his fingers] It tastes good!\n\nJAKE: Don't do that.\n\nAMIR: Don't tell me what to do; only one person can tell me what to do, and he's standing right here. [points to Mike]\n\nMIKE: Yeah, you really shouldn't do that.\n\nAMIR: Then I won't.\n\nJAKE: Why do you think he's Shia LaBeouf? Why do you think that?\n\nAMIR: Chia the frickin' Bean!

Shia, please! Enlighten the man!\n\nMIKE: My name is Mike, and I'm not a celebrity.\n\nAMIR: ...Wow! [pause] Ever humble, even though this motherfucker starred in Holes, then went on to fill up Megan Fox's holes! I'm serious, dude! You gotta tell me about that shit! I want the deets! I have such a crush on her.\n\nJAKE: This is so inappropriate for work!\n\nAMIR: Wow, Jake's never been to Hollywood, Nollywood, nor Bollywood. And it's clear to me that Megan Fox jumped on your jolly wood, and rode that dolly good!\n\nJAKE: Will you please let Mike work?\n\nAMIR: I will! And I'll help him work; in fact, I want to be your Johnny Drama and your Turtle. If there's anything you need, I'm your man. I might be a vegetarian, but tonight... I'm eating Beef!\n\nJAKE: You're not a vegetarian.\n\nAMIR: That's actually a good point: we should release a sex tape.\n\nJAKE: I didn't say that.\n\nAMIR: No no no, something tasteful at first-- you know, a little kissy-kissy, a little anal-- and then, when people aren't ready for it, boom! We hit 'em with the big one! We're viral!\n\nJAKE: What's tasteful about kissy-kissy and then going to anal?\n\nAMIR: Kissy-kissy!

Don't do me the dishonor, the disrespect of calling it a \"frat\"? Okay? It's a fraternity.

Upsilon Upsilon Upsilon doesn't believe in hazing, okay? They believe in the bond, forged by brothers, committing acts of courage for one another.\n\nAMIR: So what did you have to do?\n\nJAKE: Eat socks, chug a bottle of absinthe 'till I puked, get whipped on my ass, wear a vibrating dildo around my neck for an entire day, call my mom, tell her my brother was dead, call my brother, tell him I was gay, and me and a bunch of other pledges had to hold each other's dicks in a basement while we walked around like elephants. It's called the elephant-walk and, uh, this elephant wishes he could forget. [chuckles] I also ate six banana peels--\n\nAMIR: Jesus! Why?\n\nJAKE: Because I'm not allowed to question why!

I have been grilled by several expert witnesses and a lot of professional cross-examiners, and I'm just sitting under oath, lying through my teeth at this point! [laughing] I actually broke twice!

This is fun. Just two best friends watching hotel television together. [chuckles] We both cherish this shit.\n\nJAKE: Nope.\n\nAMIR: Oh my God, congratulations! It took you thirty seconds for you to make me feel like garbage-trash today! That's a record!\n\nJAKE: It was, like, three seconds.\n\nAMIR: And the shit just keeps on...

What do you do, just sit inside of your room and jerk off all day? [pauses, shrugs, then pulls out his iPhone and moves his hand toward his pants]\n\nJAKE: Oh, my God! Are you kidding me? [grabs the iPhone]\n\nAMIR: So we can't even spank it?\n\nAMIR: Can I hold the remote now?\n\nJAKE: You can't hold the remote, because last time you did, you ate one of the batteries.\n\nAMIR: Oh, here we go, it's story time! Hey children, gather 'round; it's time for Jake to tell us a tall tale! Please, Jake, remind me what happened next!\n\nJAKE: You know what? I will remind you, because you were blackout drunk! You put a battery in your mouth, you washed it down with an entire bottle of vodka from the minibar, and then said, \"I'll take that free ride to the ER now!\"\n\n[Amir flips the bird with both hands.]\n\nAMIR: [on the phone] Hey, room service? Yes, can I get two cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad, and can you take that entire order and shove it up your butt? That's right: go fuck yourself! You've just been Punk'd by Ashton Coutchard! Ha, I wouldn't eat your pig slop if you forced me to butt-chug it!\n\nJAKE: You know they can tell what room you're calling from, right?\n\nAMIR: Oh, bullshit. They did say 228, but I guarantee that's a lucky guess. [on the phone] Yup. Jake Hurwitz speaking.\n\nJAKE: You know, when the doctors X-rayed you, they found more than one battery. They found five or six AA's, a nine-volt, and an entire roll of copper wire.\n\nAMIR: It's electric!\n\nJAKE: That's the terrible joke you made on the operating table to deafening silence, as the nurses sawed into you.\n\nAMIR: Boogie-woogie-woogie. [laughs]\n\nJAKE: You should be dead.\n\nAMIR: Enough! Absolutely no more!\n\nAMIR: [flipping channels] Garbage, fake news, reality trash, propaganda, propaganda, the weather channel... Skinemax?

Yup, room 228-- no no no no no, don't hang up, that was-- my boy got a hold of the phone earlier, and you know how kids can be. Anyway, we would actually like to order lunch this time. Do you guys have, like, a small seaweed salad? Maybe like a quinoa starter of sorts that you could just roll up into, like, a... like a torpedo and shove up your ass? Like, just shove it up your goddamn ass? [laughs] That's right! My name is Jacob Penn Cooper Valerie Blumenwitz and you were just the victim of a Jerky-Boys-style stunt, AKA a flash mob!\n\n[Amir has his butt up in the air. He farts noisily.]\n\nAMIR: Did you Instavideo that?\n\nJAKE: No.\n\nAMIR: Ass!\n\nAMIR: [on the phone] Hello, room service? No no no, I'm sorry, please, no no, don't hang up, don't hang up. That was my brother. He's going through these-- I actually am calling to apologize. He's going through this, like, pha-- it's not even worth getting into. We actually-- I know this is hard to believe, but we really do want some food. I feel like the boy who cried wolf, but if you can just find it in your heart to-- to believe me one last time, I really w-- I'll make it worth your while. I'll pay you 200 percent. [pause] Gosh, thank you-- thank you so much. I so-- I so, so much appreciate it. [Jake buries his face in a pillow] I don't have a menu on me, but if you have, like a-- any spaghetti dish, like a pasta, like a penne vodka, something tomato-and-cheesy, that you can shove up your ass! That you can shove up your goddamn ass! [laughs] Hello? Hel-- oh my God, you gotta be kidding me! That's like the third time they hung up on me!\n\n[There's a loud knock.]\n\nAMIR: Oh my God, dude, dude, dude, you gotta get that.\n\nAMIR: [off screen, crying] Please, please, please! I'm so sorry for prank-calling the hotel! You really- I don't know what got over me, but you can't kick me out! You really cannot kick me out! I deserve to stay here! You don't understand, this is like a vacation for us; this is like a once-in-a-lifetime frickin' thing--\n\nJAKE: Just apologize!\n\nAMIR: [still crying] I'm not going to apologize; it was a joke!\n\nAMIR: [still crying] Got 'em.\n\nJAKE: \"Got 'em\"? Really?\n\nAMIR: Yeah.\n\nJAKE: You just cried in front of a hotel clerk for thirty minutes 'til he got bored and left.\n\nAMIR: [on the phone, still crying] Hello, room service? Yeah, can I have, like, a soup, and can you shove it up your, your goddamn-- yeah, your goddamn ass. Thank you. [to Jake] They would.

Salut.\n\nJAKE: Alright man, that's great, and no, no you didn't, you posted nineteen hundred times in the last day. Most recently, two seconds ago, which means you were posting as you were lying to me.\n\nAMIR: Sorry... what?\n\nJAKE: You know the last thing you posted was in the subreddit Earth Porn?\n\nAMIR: Yeah, haha! Sorry.\n\nJAKE: It's not a good thing, so.

Your last three questions were about money, crayons, and eating. Most five year olds understand crayons and eating. A lot of them understand money.\n\nAMIR: The comments were helpful, and I appreciated them.\n\nJAKE: How is this helpful? Under your eating post, somebody wrote \"OP is a dumbass and a loser. Just let yourself die.\"\n\nAMIR: To which I zung'd him back!\n\nJAKE: You wrote \"How does it feel like to make a thirty year old cry? Gentlemen, shower this d-bag with d-votes.\"\n\nAMIR: To which society dealt him more than a fatal blow.\n\nJAKE: They gave him eleven thousand upvotes.\n\nAMIR: And counting!\n\nJAKE: You commented on his post \"I'd make you eat my dick if it weren't already off for sir Michael Chik. Ask me anytime.\" Did you even set up an AMA for that?\n\nAMIR: Didn't need to.\n\nJAKE: Yes. Yes you do. And, how do you have your dick off for someone? Explain that to me like I'm five. And why would you do it, if you're gonna do it, For Michael Chiklis!\n\nAMIR: You know what, enough. Okay?

Is that some kind of dig at my nose?\n\nJAKE: Yes! Obviously! It wasn't thinly veiled!\n\nAMIR: I can't handle this right now! I gotta go back to the store and get the numbers on these tickets to match the one on the site!\n\nJAKE: Great, so they don't match right now.\n\nAMIR: Not right now!

[whispering, to Jake] Watch this! [on the phone] Unfortunately, the couch is unavailable! Yes, it is because of how you answered the question.

[Amir nods] You're telling me a story; you're not asking me.\n\nAMIR: And I had, um... [pause] tomatoes?\n\nJAKE: ...Did you have it or not? I don't know.\n\nAMIR: I had tomatoes?\n\nJAKE: Okay?\n\nAMIR: But hey! No bread, so I, uh... [long pause] I open the fridge, and I'm like \"You know what, Jake\"--\n\nJAKE: --\"Amir\"--\n\nAMIR: --\"Jake, today's the day... today's the day you finally... you figure it out. You figure it out, and you get it done.\" So, uh... let me cut you off a slice, huh? [grabbing a knife]\n\nJAKE: You know what? I-- you know, I appreciate the offer. I actually am just not that hungry.\n\nAMIR: [sawing the bread loaf] Come on, please? It'll mean a lot to me if you... try a slice!\n\nJAKE: No, I know it would mean a lot to you. That's one of the reasons I don't want to try the bread.\n\nAMIR: [still sawing] I'm curious to see what you think about it.\n\nJAKE: I wish you were less curious.\n\nAMIR: [holding the bread off the table, still sawing] Whether you like it or not is actually what I'm most curious about!\n\nJAKE: Right, of course. I know.\n\n[Amir finishes cutting a slice of bread. He hands it to Jake.]\n\nAMIR: Here you go. Careful, it is hard.\n\n[Amir drops the bread, and it makes a clanking sound. Jake picks it up.]\n\nJAKE: ...Why?\n\nAMIR: Sometimes bread comes out like that.\n\n[Jake tries to bite into the bread, and fails.]\n\nJAKE: Ow! Really hard.\n\nAMIR: Well, it's a work in progress, sure, okay, but there's a learning curve.\n\nJAKE: This is chalk!\n\nAMIR: That is uncalled for! It is chalky, to be sure, but there are some redeeming characteristics.\n\nJAKE: No, like this bread is legitimately chalk! I mean-- [pulls out a chalkboard, draws on it using the bread] --look!\n\nAMIR: Enough! More than enough, actually, okay? There's constructive criticism, and then there's this-- this-- this-- this-- this poison that you say to me...\n\nJAKE: This bread is poison!\n\nAMIR: Do you like it... or not?\n\nJAKE: Like it? I can't even bring myself to bite into it! This slice alone is the density of a brick! I mean, it's amazing!\n\nAMIR: Appreciated!\n\nJAKE: Never a compliment.\n\nAMIR: Alright, here: try it with some of this homemade jam! [Handing Jake a plastic container with a live rabbit sitting in it] Yeah! Just spread that liberally on the chalk-- or, bread. [laughing] Now you have me saying \"chalk\", ya dingbat!\n\nJAKE: How?\n\nAMIR: No-- I don't know how! You said \"chalk\", and then suddenly I'm saying \"chalk\" instead of \"bread\". It's a whole thing.\n\nJAKE: No, I mean, like, how do you have this? How do you think it's jam?\n\nAMIR: It is jam! You just press its head against the bread-- not chalk mind you-- [laughs] and then you use a knife to sort of squeeze its little jam insides out of its anus onto the cha-- [pause] bread, oh my God, I hate you!\n\n[Jake stares, dumbfounded, at Amir.]\n\nAMIR: Here! Here! Give me that-- give me that rabbit jam. I'll show you.\n\nJAKE: No! I will not!\n\nAMIR: Excuse you.\n\nJAKE: Excuse you!\n\nAMIR: No, excuse you!\n\nJAKE: Absolutely excuse you!\n\nAMIR: Give me the rabbit back, my friend.\n\n[Jake gets up and leaves with the rabbit.]\n\nAMIR: Hey-- hey! Get-- that guy's getting away with my jam! Get back here, you thief!\n\n[Amir picks up the remaining loaf and throws it at Jake. He misses and hits Rosie in the head.]\n\nROSIE: Ahh!\n\nAMIR: Oh!\n\nDAVE: [kneeling by Rosie's corpse] He's dead...\n\nEND", "duration": "3:07", "air_date": "2013-11-19", "scribe": "fwavoy", "_type": "episode"}

If I may be so bold as to ask: how is that fair?\n\nJAKE: That is a bold question, but it is actually not fair, because in a fair world, you would be dead.\n\nAMIR: You don't have to be a roach about it!\n\nJAKE: Finally, delirious with anger or maybe possessed by the devil, you barrel-rolled down the escalator back onto the casino floor, in nothing but an open bathrobe and a cowboy hat. You yelled \"I'm gonna buy a blood diamond worth of blow! Who's coming back to my room with me?\"\n\n[Amir blows more bubbles toward Jake.]\n\nJAKE: That's when Lydia-- who, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her: Lydia, I can only assume you're a garbage-can whore-- came back up to the room. By the way, honey, there's no blow up here. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, but--\n\n[Lydia jumps out of the tub and begins strangling Jake.]\n\nLYDIA: What did you say? [to Amir] You promised! [continues screaming at Jake]\n\nJAKE: What? [to Amir] You said I could say anything I wanted to in front of her!\n\nAMIR: Kat! I said you could say anything you wanted to in front of Kat! That's Lydia! She's a feisty one. This [gesturing to another bikini-clad girl showing up] is Kat!\n\nKAT: Did you say something about Lydia, motherfucker?\n\n[Kat begins yelling at Jake and choking him as well.]\n\nEND", "duration": "3:15", "air_date": "2014-02-11", "scribe": "fwavoy", "_type": "episode"}

I'm sorry, you're a cunt! [Simultaneously] JAKE: You're an ass, you're an asshole. I don't want this gift from you. You're- I'm- shutup dude!\n\nAMIR: I'm sorry.

Alright, you know what?\n\nCUT TO: Jake pulling Amir's canyon note out of the bag:\n\nJAKE pulls the note out which says:\n\nFUCK OFF JAKE!!\n\nYOU RAT COWARD!Jake sighs and returns the note. He gets up and walks away\n\nIn the new LA office boardroom. Employees are standing around chatting. Amir enters.\n\nAMIR (singing): Make way, for prince Amir...\n\nThe employees start booing and throwing paper at Amir. Someone pulls a chair out from under him and he falls down. Everyone cheers and laughs. Someone helps Amir up and then spits in his face before another employee staples his neck\n\nAMIR: Ow! Ow!\n\nJake runs in\n\nJAKE: Hey! Hey! Come on! What are you guys doing? This is insane, it's no way to treat somebody on their first day of work.

Alright, tell you what man, the RV is outside!\n\nAMIR: Enough.\n\nJAKE: I can move back to New York.

I mean, this is LA.\n\nJAKE: You gotta learn how to give a joke, cause that's rude.\n\nAMIR: Wow...\n\nJAKE: What I just did was really nice and then you hit me with the Rubi- you didn't even say thank you.\n\nAmir starts to make beeping noises\n\nJAKE: Back it up?\n\nAMIR: Back it up.

IT? Yeah, this is Jake Amir Blumenfeldwitz from the fifth floor? [lifting an old printer onto his desk] I have a brand new, heavily used 1982 Inkjet printer!\n\nJAKE: How is that brand new?\n\nAMIR: Brand new ink! [on the phone] Sorry. [to Jake again] Brand new ink! Okay? Yeah, the cyan was replaced last week, but the yellow and magenta are butt-old!\n\nJAKE: So then the ink's not brand new either.\n\nAMIR: [on the phone] That's right, I desire to connect. So why don't you come upstairs and hook a printa up!\n\nJAKE: You know, there's a lot of mouse droppings in there.\n\nAMIR: That's right!\n\nJAKE: What do you even need to print?\n\nAMIR: Travel much?\n\nJAKE: What?\n\nAMIR: Boarding passes... asses! Or do you check in curbside!\n\nJAKE: When is the last time you flew?\n\n[The IT guy shows up.]\n\nIT GUY: Hey, if you want to print, just select the default printer from the server here.\n\nAMIR: Oh, okay, yeah, connect to your server? So you can jack my shit, jack my boarding passes?\n\nJAKE: Come on.\n\nAMIR: [chuckling] Soon you'll be... spending cross-cuntinental trips on my dime? Wh-wha-what, Christmas in Maui?

It sounds like you want to just open up a poster store.\n\nAMIR: That's actually a pretty dece idea. Maybe a poster store in the front, a cool cafe in the back, and a little spot to put air in your tires if you ride a bike!\n\nJAKE: God, you're a bad businessman.\n\nAMIR: I'm not a businessman.

I... I hasn't has one in a while, and I was... simply... curious as to whether or not I can has one. A cheezburger.\n\nAMIR: This one's less of a poster and more of a drink, but it's like a... orange juice and soda water.\n\nJAKE: That's entirely a drink.

Call it to my face and see what happens.\n\nJAKE: Can you please just focus. Alright? I said I'd give you a driving lesson if you would focus.\n\nAMIR: Yeah? Well learning shit is for aunts and dweebs! And last time I checked...\n\nJAKE: \"I'm have a pussy\"?\n\nAMIR: [simultaneously] ...I'm have a pussy. Yeah!\n\nJAKE: Yeah, you've said that before.\n\nAMIR: Exactly right. Can we-- ...can we just listen to the radio? Alright? Music helps me drive!\n\nJAKE: Music doesn't help you drive, at all. You hopped the curb back there 'cause you were listening to a Big Sean song.\n\nAMIR: I'm sorry if music distracts me! I think that's pretty normal, actually.\n\nJAKE: Be sorry that you just tried to lie, to get me to turn it back on! Okay? Y-- y--you gotta learn how to drive, if you're living in Los Angeles.\n\nAMIR: [mocking Jake] I-- I--I know how to drive, alright? I'm a regular James Deen.\n\nJAKE: Jesus.\n\nAMIR: What?\n\nJAKE: Jerk.\n\nAMIR: I can't... you know what?... I can't see anything. I think I need my sunglasses.\n\nJAKE: Alright, fine. I'll grab them. Where are they--\n\nAMIR: No, I got 'em, I got 'em, I got 'em.\n\n[Amir leans way back into the backseat to look for his sunglasses. Jake grabs the wheel.]\n\nJAKE: Hey, hey-- hey-- dude! Hey! Idiot!\n\nAMIR: I got 'em, dude! I g--\n\nJAKE: You idiot!\n\nAMIR: Why am I an idiot? Okay? There's a lot of glare. It'll be much safer if I just find my shades!\n\nJAKE: Eyes on the road, buddy.\n\nAMIR: I don't need 'em on the road, buddy! Alright? Relax. I--\n\n[Jake shushes Amir.]\n\nAMIR: [singing] Beware, beware, beware...\n\nJAKE: Find the glasses.\n\nAMIR: [singing] ...of a woman with a broken fart! [farts loudly]\n\nJAKE: Oh! Smelly!\n\n[Amir sits back in his seat, wearing heart-shaped sunglasses.]\n\nAMIR: Got 'em, baby!\n\nJAKE: Jesus Christ.\n\nAMIR: Pussy-whipped much?\n\nJAKE: ...What?\n\nAMIR: I swear, dude. You let women walk all over you. You gotta--\n\nJAKE: I don't-- ...stop it. Okay?\n\nAMIR: Okay...\n\nJAKE: I don't feel like having a conversation right now.\n\nAMIR: Me neither, so we're both... on the same page, as it were. [pronouncing \"page\" in French]\n\nJAKE: Good, so then we just be quiet, and we don't have to say anything to each other.\n\nAMIR: Fine. [pause] It's funny... this whole thing reminds me of my old man teaching me how to drive. [chuckles] Was sittin' in the same seat you were. If you can belee dat!\n\nJAKE: I can belee dat. Just, please, can we not talk about your family? I--\n\nAMIR: Cursing the only god he knew that he lost that rock-paper-scissors match against my mommy. \"Loser has to teach Queen Dweeb to drive!\" That's what they said.\n\nJAKE: \"Queen Dweeb\"?\n\nAMIR: \"Queen Dweeb\". That was their nickname for me. They used to yell it me, taunt me, throw shit at me like the, uh... what's the inside of a-- of a peach?\n\nJAKE: ...The pit?\n\nAMIR: Yeah. They used to throw knives at me.\n\nJAKE: Why did you ask me about peach pits?\n\nAMIR: Because you gotta cut the peach with something! ...Idiot!\n\nJAKE: Jesus Christ, that is depressing. Just... driving-wise, okay...\n\nAMIR: Yeah?\n\nJAKE: Just remember to use your signals when we're changing lanes.\n\nAMIR: [doing an arm signal] I use arm signals. [sticking his arm in front of Jake] Hi-ya! Less legal, sure--\n\nJAKE: Eyes on the road.\n\nAMIR: --but... way less effective, too.\n\nJAKE: So you said \"less\" twice, then.\n\nAMIR: Yeah. [chuckles] Oh, God, these driving lessons. Daddy used to sit right there; me, crying in the front seat like a five-year-old. \"I don't want to drive today, Papa! I can't reach the pedals!\"\n\nJAKE: ...Excuse me?\n\nAMIR: I was four.\n\nJAKE: God, your parents suck, dude.\n\nAMIR: Excuse me! Say that again! Say that again to my face and I will drive this car into a cat, so help me cod, you fishy bitch!\n\nJAKE: Keep your eyes on the road!\n\nAMIR: I can't see shit, dude! These glasses are not prescription!\n\nJAKE: Then take them off!\n\nAMIR: [leaning back into the backseat again] Let me put them back in the case!\n\nJAKE: Hey! Dude!\n\nAMIR: What, dude!

What hobbies do you even have?\n\nAMIR: Not really a hobby, but I'm pretty good at alienating significant others. Like if one of y'all's girlfriends or wives were here, I'd make her feel uninvited, unwelcome... I'd phase her out of the conversation, slowly but surely. [chuckles] Box her out physically, just so she doesn't feel like one of us.\n\nJAKE: Why would you think that's even close to a hobby? It's the opposite of a hobby.

Can I change the channel, or do we have to watch this soccer shit?\n\n[Jake pushes Amir's hand off of him.]\n\nAMIR: [on the phone] Hi, twat. Yeah, can we get two large pizzas, one medium pie, and, let's say, seven small 'zas?\n\nPAUL: Those are all just different words for the same thing.\n\nRACHEL: And we already have pizza.\n\nAMIR: And chicken wings? Yeah, I love those frickin' things.\n\nJAKE: Can you not order in weird rhymes?

Futbol!\"\n\n[Paul smiles.]\n\nJAKE: Of course we noticed that.\n\nAMIR: Then laugh! It's an observational humor!\n\nJAKE: It's not humor. It's just an observation.\n\nAMIR: Still! A chuckle would have been decent. Got this fatass to grin about it! [laughs]\n\nPAUL: Oh, no. My cousin just sent me a text that made me smile. It wasn't you.\n\nAMIR: [still laughing] Count it!\n\nAMIR: [on the phone] My credit card number is, um, uh... [laughing] it's sixty-nine.\n\nJAKE: Give me the phone.\n\nAMIR: Alright.

They don't affect anyone or anything.\n\nPAT: No-- what are your hobbies?\n\nAMIR: Well, not really a hobby, but when my family and I dine at restaurants that give you beepers while you wait for a table, I'll always pretend like it's buzzing. Make my dumbass mom or my goofy dad walk up to the waitress, time after time, in vain. [chuckles] Then at the end of the bit, I'll throw the beeper away so that my dad ends up owing cash for it.\n\nJAKE: Your hobbies are bad.\n\nAMIR: No shit, dude.\n\nJAKE: You're bad.\n\nAMIR: All I'm saying is that real athletes don't wear cleats.

Jake waits for a while for him to keep talking.]\n\nAMIR: ...What?\n\nJAKE: ...AKA what?\n\nAMIR: What are you, waiting for me to talk? [laughs] Alright! Let's talk!\n\nJAKE: Waiting for you to finish!

That's not leading a healthy lifestyle. You can't afford to eat that food.\n\nAMIR: My legs were tired, fatass! And by the way, this is healthy! Healthier than the standing desk, 'cause I can do crunches while I work! [closes his eyes and begins doing crunches badly]\n\nJAKE: Your eyes are shut. So you're not doing anything while you work. You're just doing crunches, and... what terrible form! You're twirling your ass on top of the ball like you're wiping with it.\n\nAMIR: Yeah, well they hurt my back pain!\n\nJAKE: Redundant.\n\nAMIR: Yeah! I have sciatica, motherfucker!\n\nJAKE: I think sciatica is pain in your leg.\n\nAMIR: Yes! Which is why I can't stand. So I sit, which hurts my back. That's why I got the desk! It just hurts, so I'm sitting, AKA!\n\nJAKE: ...If you're this sick, if you're this unhealthy, why don't you just do the decent thing, and allow yourself to die?\n\nAMIR: ...Jesus!\n\nJAKE: That was real.\n\nAMIR: That's, like, a lot of times you ask me to die.\n\nJAKE: I know, and I mean it every time.\n\nAMIR: [laughing uncomfortably] It's so... sad.\n\nJAKE: Trust me, I know.\n\nAMIR: It's sad to me that you want me dead.\n\nJAKE: I feel bad as a person that I want so badly for you to be dead and gone, but I--\n\nAMIR: Yeah. You're not even hiding it anymore.\n\nJAKE: No, I think I'm just gonna be open with it.\n\nAMIR: I need to... I need to lay down.\n\n[Amir lays down on the floor.]\n\nJAKE: Thirty seconds ago, you were boasting about your standing desk, and now you're on the floor.\n\nAMIR: [still eating his nachos] It doesn't matter if I'm sitting or lying, okay? As long as my work gets handed in.\n\nJAKE: What work are you handing in? You're just shoveling nachos into your face, lying down on the ground, and-- oh my God, you're asleep.\n\n[Amir has fallen asleep on the floor.]\n\nJAKE: How is that possible? You were just yelling. Now you're asleep.\n\n[Amir begins choking on his mouthful of nachos. Jake runs over to help him, and then reconsiders. He watches Amir struggle for air in his sleep, until Amir eventually lies still on the ground.]\n\nJAKE: [looking upward, and whispering] Thank you...\n\n[Amir suddenly coughs up his nachos all over Jake.]\n\nAMIR: I'm alive!\n\nJAKE: Ass.\n\nAMIR: [laughing in relief] And it's all thanks to that standing desk.\n\n[Jake scowls at Amir.]\n\nAMIR: What?\n\nEND", "duration": "3:03", "air_date": "2014-08-19", "scribe": "fwavoy", "_type": "episode"}

He has a friend named Sale.\n\nJAKE: He's got a friend named Sale?\n\nAMIR: Well, had a friend named Sal.\n\nJAKE: ...Sale, or Sal?\n\nAMIR: Sale. Sale.\n\nJAKE: Which one?\n\nAMIR: Sale!\n\nJAKE: Sale, or Sal?\n\nAMIR: Sam!\n\nJAKE: Which one is it? Sale, Sal, or Sam?\n\nAMIR: ...Sale.\n\nJAKE: Doesn't matter. Okay, you got the grill off him?\n\nAMIR: Off her. And no, not her grill, her teeth. Okay? When she passed, me and Leron had the dim idea  to gank the dentures off her still-breathing body!\n\nJAKE: Still breathing. So she hadn't passed.\n\nAMIR: We're all at the vet trying to huff some of that laughy gassy, when we realized: uh-oh! Some of it's euthanasia! So me and Leron hightail it the fuck out of there, but, uh... Sale wasn't too lucky. She couldn't flap her wings fast enough.\n\nJAKE: Flap her wings?\n\nAMIR: Did I mention Sale was a goose?\n\nJAKE: ...No! No, of course not, 'cause then all my questions would have been about that! Why did the goose have teeth?\n\nAMIR: I guess you can say she's trans-gandered!\n\nJAKE: Decent pun, doesn't explain the teeth, and your gums are bleeding.\n\nAMIR: [with his hand on his mouth] Sure, small price to pay.\n\nJAKE: Kind of a lot of blood, and it's a pretty big price to pay, man! You don't have teeth. You and your cousin are friends with a goose.\n\nAMIR: Were!\n\nJAKE: Still! A goose!\n\nAMIR: No, I mean me and Leron aren't cousins anymore! He frickin' divorced me!\n\nJAKE: Please, just one insane thing at a time. Why did the goose have teeth?\n\nAMIR; Dentures.\n\nJAKE: Which you stole.\n\nAMIR: How was your weekend? ...Always talkin' about my shit. How was your Friday? What'd you do Saturday morning?\n\nJAKE: Where are your real teeth?\n\nAMIR: I traded them to Leron for a BeDazzler so that I can jewel-encrust Sale's dentures so that I can flaunt my father's wealth! What don't you get?\n\nJAKE: Why do you hate yourself?\n\nAMIR: Excuse?\n\nJAKE You're on this twisted quest to change your body, mind, and spirit. You're constantly adopting new hobbies. [Amir begins dancing in his seat.] You've had countless plastic surgeries-- stop dancing! [Amir stops.] None of it is ever to any avail. At the end of the day, you're still you... and you suck.\n\n[Amir makes a mock-hurt expression.]\n\nJAKE: Oh, I know that did hurt.\n\n[Amir dabs his forehead, and salutes Jake sarcastically. Jake salutes him back. Amir pauses, and then begins crying.]\n\nJAKE: There it is. [claps] Finally. That's what I was hoping for. That's the way you should always be.\n\nAMIR: Want to know the gayest part?\n\nJAKE: Don't use that word like that.\n\nAMIR: I truly believe that the world revolves around me. [pauses, nods thoughtfully] Not even metaphorically, either. Like, uh, say this marble is me, and this tennis ball is our solar system? [picks up a marble and a tennis ball, and rolls the tennis ball around the marble]\n\nJAKE: Quick to get those.\n\nAMIR: Yeah, this is how I feel. Like I am at the center of it. Like I'm the Sun. [chuckles] I mean, how dumb is that?\n\nJAKE: It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Nothing revolves around you. You absolutely don't matter, 'cause you're a goose murderer. You're a teeth thief.\n\nAMIR: Yeah? Well at least I got a grill I can count on! [holds up a sausage] Hope you like sausage!\n\nJAKE: Raw meat. In your mouth.\n\n[Amir puts the sausage to its mouth, and it begins smoking and sizzling.]\n\nJAKE: Holy shit, how is it sizzling?\n\nAMIR: I'm the Sun!

You clearly stole this from the Apple store.\n\nAMIR: I paid for it with my privacy. You know Apple owns your shit, right?\n\nAMIR: I think I'll order a V-neck and a plaid, 'cause I'm from Teaneck, and hi, I'm Brad! [extends his hand for a handshake]\n\nJAKE: Alright.

And business isn't booming.\n\n[Amir begins shushing Jake.]\n\nJAKE: You're never right.

It was so fast.\n\nAMIR: Oh!\n\nJAKE: \"Oh\" is right, man. Your shopping cart is getting really expensive. You're not even comparing prices across other sites. I don't even think you're looking at the sizing chart with a discerning eye.

I mean, I'm buying these platinum-white dress shoes, but I literally will never wear them.\n\nJAKE: So don't buy them.\n\nAMIR: Well, what if I get invited to a gala, ass?\n\nJAKE: A gala? I've never seen anyone invite you to lunch!\n\n[Amir scratches Jake's face.]\n\nJAKE: Ow--\n\nAMIR: [speaking to the viewer] You know, whenever I go online shopping, I like to reward myself with a little \"you're worth it\" gift. [chuckles] And today I got myself this zebra-print pillow! [holding up a pillow] I'm obsessed!\n\nJAKE: Who are you talking to?\n\n[Jake is holding a cloth to his cheek.]\n\nJAKE: I can't believe you scratched me.\n\nAMIR: I'm sorry.\n\nJAKE: Like a cat.\n\nAMIR: I was upset.\n\nJAKE: I don't care.\n\nAMIR: You offended me!\n\nJAKE: So what?\n\nAMIR: If it makes you feel any better, I might even get a plus one to the gala!\n\nJAKE: You're not going to a gala!\n\n[Amir reaches out to scratch Jake, and Jake holds him back by the wrist.]\n\nJAKE: Hey-- no!\n\nAMIR: Say that again, and I will scratch your other face!\n\nAMIR: Hey, pretty neat little lifehack: if you put in a pseudonym in the shipping information, like Vance or something, the package will show up with that fake name on it.\n\nJAKE: That's not a lifehack. That's the most boring idea in the world. You'll just have a package with the name Vance on it.\n\nAMIR: Yeah, but then after a while, the mailman will start to call you Vance! He'll be like, \"Hey Vance, how's it going?\" You'll be like, \"Oh, it's pretty good, but actually boom! Gotcha! My name's Brad!\"\n\n[Jake is holding a bloody cloth on each cheek.]\n\nAMIR: These white shoes are breaking the bank, but I feel like I gotta have 'em.

You really like me!\" Friday night, I crash a feminist meeting, and told each and every one of them the God's honest truth: that they were all on the rag! Their aunt Flo didn't just come into town to visit. She moved in, and they were becoming scissor sisters. I wish one thing led to another, because what happened next was all at once. They tied my wrists to my face, shoved a tampon in my asshole, and kicked me out into the street! Keep in mind, this was 7:45 PM, so it's still bright out and I'm missing Jeopardy! I will take \"Things You Don't Want Your Parents to See after Leaving a Restaurant for Their Forty-Second Anniversary\" for, let's say, two hundred, Alex.

Bom, bom. What is their thirty-one-year-old son scooting across the sidewalk like a baby in a diaper, trying to grind the tampon out of his bleeding asshole while he howls at the moon like a wolf! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! And what did you wager, Alex? Zero dollars? That's... that's funny, 'cause that's how much my life was worth to the police officer who, rather than unbind me, took out his Motorola Krzr and added me to his SnapStory. What? Just as I start to think outside the bun, you know, convincing myself that at the very least this will be a fun little anecdote to tell at my bachelor party-- if I don't decide to go stag to my own wedding-- four of these femmes fatales emerge from the shadows, [pointing to his body] and start assaulting my face, [pointing to his neck] my body, [pointing to his face] and my neck. All of them had hair of gold, [singing the \"Brady Bunch\" theme] like their mother... the youngest one threw squirrels! One landed in my mouth, like a furry ball gag. Finally, out of fear, loathing, or Las Vegas, I j-- [chuckles] I just start spray-shitting everywhere. Yeah, it's like someone's dumping bucket after bucket of chocolate pudding on a rotating helicopter blade. I am defecating hither and thither, still howling, still at the moon, this time blue corn. With the tampon finally out, hands still tied to my face, [Ace Ventura impression] I finally have the wherewithalrighty then! to let out on more zinger. One more joke, this one luckily not at their expense. It's-- it's pretty broad, actually. [taking off his glasses] It goes a little something like this: A woman boards a bus with her newborn baby, and the bus driver says, \"Hey, ma'am, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen.\" The woman, appalled-- frankly, she has the right to be-- sits down next to me and says, \"That bus driver just insulted me.\" I said, \"Lady, you don't have to take that from him. You go up there and tell him off. Here, I'll hold your monkey.\"\n\n[Jake chuckles.]\n\nAMIR: Seeing you chuckle at that joke made the entire weekend worthwhile.\n\nJAKE: Oh-- no.

I knew as soon as I went off and did something cute and subjective, you would turn it into this, this, this, this, this, this nuclear bomb of me!\n\nJAKE: You know what? Talk normal. Okay? \"Nuclear bomb of me\"? \"Smile of you\"? You're digressing! You used to be able to speak English.\n\n[Amir is raising his arms defensively.]\n\nJAKE: Put your arms down! What are you doing?\n\nAMIR: Your attitude almost makes me not want to write a song and perform it for you at work... yeah!\n\nJAKE: Good. That... that is the first time I've ever seen you come close to making a right decision.\n\nAMIR: Excuse...?\n\nJAKE: That inkling that you have--\n\nAMIR: You're a dickling!\n\nJAKE: I said \"inkling\", but you are the dickling. Okay?\n\nAMIR: You're a dickling!\n\nJAKE: The inkling that you have, to not do something because you know I'll think it's dumb? That's the first step into, I guess, adolescence. You finally have the social intelligence of an eleven-year-old.\n\nAMIR: Well if you like that song, then you truly are the apple of my pie.\n\n[Amir pulls out an apple pie, and pies himself in the face with it. It slides off gradually, and Amir looks disappointed in himself.]\n\nAMIR: [to himself] Why'd you do that, ya idiot? ...You turn every positive into a weird thing of you. Just take the compliment, Hurwitz! You are an anal assassin of the highest calendar. He finally was on your side. He liked the song.\n\nJAKE: I never said I liked the song.\n\nAMIR: You said I had the social intelligence of an eleven-year-old!\n\nJAKE: ...What word in that sentence says \"song\"?\n\nAMIR: AKA!\n\nJAKE: I have to work from home.\n\nAMIR: Of course! And you can't give me a ride home because--\n\nJAKE: I dislike being with you.\n\nAMIR: --my guitar won't fit. Exactly right.\n\n[Jake gets up to leave.

I wonder how that got in there-- oh, maybe it was from a one-night stand I had with a 10!\n\nJAKE: [grabbing the underwear] You know what? This is embarrassing, 'cause I saw you open a new package of women's underwear, smell them, crumple them up, and put them in the bottom of the bag. You fake-dropped them on the floor in front of me twice, hoping I would notice, then you finally just dangled them in front of my face and said \"how embarrassing\".

It's just cotton clothing. You reek of piss.\n\nAMIR: Eureka! [laughs] Sorry. It just sounded like you said \"eu--\"\n\nJAKE: You smell like pee.\n\nAMIR: I know.\n\nAMIR: Tickle fight!\n\n[Amir tickles Jake, who reflexively punches him in the face.

Ever been to a foam party?\n\nJAKE: You know, you ruined all your clothes, you broke your washer, it's gonna cost you a lot of money.\n\nAMIR: To get into the club? I don't think so! Not if I bring in tits and slits! Okay?

I wanted a bigger reaction. Let me give you some more options.\n\nJAKE: No, no no no--\n\n[Amir is dressed as a doctor in scrubs.]\n\nAMIR: Fun thing about this costume: you can wear it after Halloween, and get into hospitals pretty easily.\n\nJAKE: Why do you need to get into hospitals?\n\nAMIR: For fun little pranks! Like two weeks ago, I walk up to a family of four in a waiting room who's [air quotes] \"awaiting news\", and I'm just covered in fake blood, and I go, \"I'm... so sorry.\" They start bawling, I can't even keep a straight face! Funny thing is, three minutes later, the real doctor comes in and tells them that their little boy had indeed actually passed away. I felt... vindicated!\n\n[Amir is wearing an illusion costume of a baby in a mother's backpack carrier.]\n\nJAKE: ...Of course not.\n\nAMIR: Wahhh!\n\n[Amir is wearing another illusion costume, made to look like he is riding a turkey.]\n\nAMIR: I think I'll quit candy next year... cold turkey!

You called me last night in tears because you were afraid a boogeyman was outside your window, trying to scare you.\n\nAMIR: He was.\n\nJAKE: You said he was staring at you from across the street, threatening you with cue cards, 'cause he didn't know how to speak?\n\nAMIR: That's right.\n\n[Amir is wearing a Maleficent gown costume.]\n\nAMIR: Who's gonna refuse to give me candy?\n\nJAKE: You go trick-or-treating? I thought this was for a costume party.\n\nAMIR: What's a costume part?\n\n[Amir is in the Ghostbusters costume, and Jake is continuing the story.]\n\nJAKE: The boogeyman's cue card said \"I can see you, you spendthrift, you Jew spendthrift. Now come down here and give me cash or I'll boogie you.\"\n\nAMIR: That's correct.\n\nJAKE: You also mentioned the other side of his sign said \"Why lie? I need pot\", so I think you might have just gotten swindled by a homeless man.\n\nAMIR: Perhaps, maybe. Mayhaps, probably.\n\nJAKE: Probably.\n\n[Amir is dressed in a German costume with lederhosen.

Get ready, I'm gonna boogie you.\" [Amir flinches.] So you ran away to the nearest ATM, and took out even more money.\n\nAMIR: Yeah, the boogeyman's appetite for cash was insatiable, to be sure. But, I stood up for myself. I refused to be boogied.\n\nJAKE: [waving his hands at Amir] Boogie-boogie-boogie-boogie!\n\nAMIR: [raising his hands in self-defense and throwing cash at Jake] Aaah!

[in a lower register, as Jake] Nice. [singsong] Thank you!\n\n[Amir is at his desk, and has Jake on video chat on his computer.]\n\nAMIR: ...So...?\n\nJAKE: You called me. It's not my job to start a conversation.\n\nAMIR: Oh, my Thanksgiving? Of course! I'll tell you everything. [chuckles] I was excited to see my loved ones and enjoy a festive meal. Unfortunately, nothing went according to flan! [holds up flan on a plate, laughs at his own joke, and then drops it on his desk] Anyway, listen to this boar shit! I get home Thanksgiving Eve Eve, and I don't know if it's the excitement or the fact that I haven't showered in a couple of... evers, but I develop a zit the size of a gumball on my forehead! I think it's inconvenient, sure, but when I woke up to my dad trying to lance and drain the bitch with a toothbrush he sharpened like a shiv, I'm equal parts appalled and dumb! The vain diva! He said my blemish would ruin everyone's appetite and holiday. So I says to him, I says, straight up, \"Look, I don't have to have dinner with you guys. Frankly, I don't want to have dinner with you guys. But I gotta eat something, or I'm gonna be hangry.\" That's hungry and angry. So he sits silently for a spell, right, and I see something wash over him, this quiet serenity, and I realize this dingbat's gonna lock me in the room! That's the split-second we both charge for the door, and maybe I knock him off course, or maybe he frickin' slipped on the oil dripping from the golf-ball-sized zit, but the roach barrels headlong into the door jamb, and he's out cold. I'm talking frigid, frigid cold. His body is ice, his pulse is... is not. Keep in mind, my old man's forty-two, so at this point, him being dead is no bueno. No bueno at all. So I, I get down on my knees and I pray that the CPR that I saw on an episode of House M.D. on somebody else's TV on an airplane five years ago fucking registered with me! That's right, I'm pumping his chest, leaning in, giving him deep mouth-to-mouth, tongue and all, and having never performed or understood the maneuver, going on just what friggin' Hugh Laurie did on the show, and my daddy's not having any of it. He starts kicking and screaming, and I shout \"Hold still or you're a dead! You're an absolute dead!\" and he-- of course, he takes that the wrong way, I mean look at me! [breaks down into cackling] He reaches down into his pocket, all of a sudden, Papa's [suddenly singing] all about that Mace, 'bout that Mace, no bubble. As in he burst my bubble, when he realized I wasn't the George-Clooney-shaped hero that he hoped I was when he P-sprayed me in the face! The noxious liquid, of absolute course, does nothing to help the zit situation, or zituation for short, and the thing swells up to the size of a tennis ball, throbbing, pulsating, and yes, eventually speaking. Unintelligent squeaks at first, but gaining intelligence by the nanosecond, a full-on sentient staph infection, methinks! My dad gets one look at this horror show, and, and-- and of course he dives out of the window, presumably to his death, but probably not, because my, my room's in the basement. I look in the mirror, and the zit, speaking in tongues at this point, though I understand, demands that I feed it. To a regular human, it's: [makes grotesque noises from his throat] --to me, it's: \"Feed me, feed me, feed me!\" [laughs] So I march downstairs on the pimple's order and begin using the turkey syringe thing, the, uh... the, the, you know, the little ear-bulb thing, the, uh, the... [as if Jake had said something] ...right, the baster. And I'm squeezin' and suckin', feeding and pouring the gravy on the zit, feeding the zit gravy, like it's the opposite of volca-- of a volcano, and it grows, both in size and anger. Finally, the bitch is so big, I'm beginning to think I'm a growth on it, and not the other way around! I mean, at this point, it's borderline comical! So naturally, I throw up my hands and I laugh. Which is right when my dad comes in and sees this-- I mean, I-- how can you describe this as, as anything else but a burlesque show? It really is a burlesque show! And he starts chuckling to himself, and I'll share credit with the evil whitehead, but I got to admit, I'm feeling not bad, because this is the first time, probably ever, that I've seen my dad smile. We go to high five, he misses, probably on purpose, and boom! He hits my zit/boil/Lord and Savior, and boom goes the dynamite. The noise is deafening. And what an explosion! Oh, the humanity! I mean, the entire room is covered in pus and gravy. It looks like... it looks like the inside of an unnatural cave, just stalactites and stalagmites of, of, of, of, of, of this, this, this, this, this, this mucus. This, this pussy, mucusy gravy. So I look-- I look at my old man, this, this forty-two-year-old raisin of a prune at this point, and I go, \"So, uh... who wants pizza?\" [laughing] He starts laughing so hard... he faints, and then my mom is also passing out, because of the, uh... the pus everywhere is steamy hot, so she's sort of suffocating on the moisture, and she faints too, and then just before I pass out, I have this thought, this, this fleeting thought, I'm like, uh... \"How the hell did I turn out so normal?\" [pauses, sighs, then waves his hand at the screen] Y'ello? Can you hear me?\n\n[Throughout Amir's entire story, Jake has been ignoring him, occupying himself instead by texting, peeling a sticker off of a thermos, and even leaving to get chips at one point. Until the present moment, Amir has been too immersed in his own story to notice.]\n\nJAKE: Yo! Hey, um, sorry. I muted you, in case you told a story that made me sad.\n\nAMIR: Oh! No wonder you didn't... [holding up the flan] you didn't laugh at the flan joke.\n\nJAKE: I heard the flan joke. That was when I muted you. It was a bad joke.\n\nAMIR: No, you... you, uh... you liked it. [laughs, pauses] You liked it.\n\nEND", "duration": "5:03", "air_date": "2014-12-02", "scribe": "fwavoy", "_type": "episode"}

You're not at risk here, in this office.\n\nAMIR: [holding up his hands, making a buzzer sound] Daaanhh! Wrong, okay?

I think alive is actually pretty crucial.\n\nJAKE: You know, you're at work. You're at your job, so it's pretty crucial for you to be doing your work.\n\nAMIR: Question, everyone: Who thinks it's important for me to be alive? [chuckles]\n\n[Nobody reacts.]\n\nAMIR: Obviously they're not paying attention. Everyone's always... y-you go out to dinner, and everyone's like: [pretending to text] \"Uh, yeah.

That smarts!\n\nJAKE: What makes you think you, of all people, are at risk for Ebola?\n\nAMIR: Glad you asked! Leron teased the nurse returning from Liberia to the point where she actually hurled her own feces at him! [laughs] Later on, Leron and I French kissed in front of a security camera as a goof, and I fear some of the original Ebola-infected feces went from his throat into mine.\n\nJAKE: If that's all true, then you deserve to have Ebola.\n\nAMIR: Excuse...?\n\nJAKE: ...Never say that again.\n\nAMIR: How do you figure, is all?\n\nJAKE: You're teasing a nurse--\n\nAMIR: No.\n\nJAKE: --who's coming back from Liberia, she went there to help--\n\nAMIR: No, no, no, no, no!

I French kissed my cousin Leron.\n\nJAKE: Okay-- after he had shit in his mouth, and he didn't wash it out!\n\nAMIR: As a goof. As a goof, I French kissed--\n\nJAKE: As a goof-- it doesn't matter!

You never said what you said you said. I don't think I've ever seen you say what you said you said.\n\nAMIR: You know, what the big issue is is that I was born too late, so all the good shit's already been done.\n\nJAKE: How dare you?

Aa-- ah. Hey, man! [throwing up a peace sign] What's up, man?\n\nMURPH: A lot is up.

It was just a-- we were just having a funny conversation. Alright? That was it. And if you'll leave me alone, I won't be afraid. My aunt's birthday is today, she's turning fifty-one, we have a nice little--\n\nMURPH: [yelling] What--\n\n[Jake jumps, and shakes in fear.]\n\nMURPH: ...was the bet, Jake?\n\nAMIR: He bet me gid wasn't a word, and it is a word.\n\nMURPH: Of course gid is a word. It's a disease found in sheep.\n\nJAKE: Okay, fair enough. But he's making compost at the office. Alright? He's keeping filthy, weird, smelly soil here at work, and that's not okay, so... so I have an idea: why don't we team up? Me and you. One time. Jake and Murph. We'll make him afraid of us. [extends his hand for a shake]\n\nMURPH: Composting is an energy-efficient way to recycle and garden. It's plenty okay. What's not okay is reneging on bets. Now what were the stakes?\n\nJAKE: It was twenty dollars. Twenty-dollar iTunes gift card. And I'm gonna pony it up. I really will. And... sucks for my aunt, 'cause she's not gonna have a birthday gift, but--\n\nAMIR: Bull!

You don't have to repeat it after me, but just so you don't get embarrassed when you're in front of your friends, its- let's do it beat by beat: \"Did\"\n\nJAKE: \"Did\"\n\nBEN: Alright, \"I\"-\n\nJAKE: -and I did that!\n\nBEN looking puzzled: No...

[to Jake] What's your name?\n\nJAKE: Jake Hurwitz.\n\nAMIR BLUMENFELD (DATING COACH): [scoffs] The exception to the rule. [to Amir] Your name?\n\nAMIR: Amir Blumenfeld!\n\n[Ben gestures at Amir excitedly.]\n\nAMIR BLUMENFELD (DATING COACH): Uhh, ah-thank-ahhh.\n\nJAKE: I don't understand... you're Amir's old dating coach. [to the couples therapist] You're our couples therapist.\n\n[The couples therapist begins doing his shrill seal laugh.]\n\nJOPE: I told you, no more of that!\n\n[Jope chloroforms the couples therapist.]\n\nAMIR: Jope!\n\nJAKE: How is this possible?\n\n[The office painter says something, but the cigarette in his mouth makes it unintelligible. Jope puts the couples therapist's hand in his pants while he's out.]\n\nJAKE: What?\n\n[The office painter repeats himself.]\n\nJAKE: Excuse me?\n\nOFFICE PAINTER: [spitting out his cigarette] Art imitating life, Jake.\n\nJAKE [to Ben, who looks like he is judging Jake] Don't do that. That's the first time he said it that way.\n\nBEN: He said \"art imitates life, Jake\" three times!\n\nAMIR: He did, yeah.\n\nJAKE: Alright.\n\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Oh, what's my name?\n\nJAKE: Nobody asked you that.\n\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: My name is...\n\nJAKE: Jim?\n\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Scal... bylausus... Jim.\n\nJAKE: Why do you introduce yourself like you're just figuring out your name for the first time?\n\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: I know my name! ...Oh, my name?\n\n[Stanley, who is on the stairs, throws a net at Jake.]\n\nSTANLEY: Hold back, hold back, hold back! Moo... moo!\n\nJAKE: I'm not a fucking cow, man.\n\nSTANLEY: You mean \"Don't have a cow, man.\"\n\nJAKE: I think you actually think that I'm a cow.\n\nSTANLEY: This is exactly what a fucking cow would say, to try to weasel and snake his way out of a confrontation--\n\nJAKE: Okay, do you hear yourself? You're saying it sounds like something a cow would say, to weasel and sn-- [to Ben] your roommate's insane.\n\nSTANLEY: You stupid fucking cow.\n\nBEN: Stanley, you know what? I'm pretty sure he's not a cow, but he is a dick.\n\n[Carrot Slat comes through the door from another room.]\n\nCARROT SLAT: How are you guys, huh? You ever figure out who shit in that copier?\n\nJAKE: Oh, no.\n\nBEN: Oh, yes. You've been a dick the entire day, Jake. Yes.\n\nJAKE: No, no, I mean \"oh no, it's Carrot\".\n\nAMIR: Carrot who?\n\nJAKE: It's Carrot Slat!\n\nAMIR: He tried to blow you!\n\nJAKE: He tr-- wha--? He did blow me!\n\nBEN: Okay.\n\nJAKE: That's enough. I want the language to change, right now, that he did...\n\nBEN: He is harmless, he is harmless.\n\n[As Jake and Ben argue, Carrot Slat is pulled back through the door. Stepping out in his place is the interrogator from Interrogator Part 2, who was apparently a different person the whole time.]\n\nINTERROGATOR: I shit in the copier.\n\nJAKE: No. No, no no no, no, no--\n\n[The interrogator punches Jake twice in the face and starts grabbing at Jake's belt.]\n\nJAKE: Ow, oh! Oh-- g--\n\n[Jake shoves him off, and the interrogator waddles away, spinning.]\n\nJAKE: Get out of here!\n\nSTANLEY: [to the interrogator] You get that dirty fucking cow!\n\n[The interrogator comes back, fists raised, punches Jake again and goes for the belt.]\n\nSTANLEY: Grade A beef!\n\nINTERROGATOR: [suddenly stepping back] Get off of me!\n\nJAKE: Don't blow me, man!\n\nBEN: Why would he blow you, Jake?\n\nJAKE: He's done it before, okay? He really has.\n\nBEN: Tried to.\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman! Looks like you got a shiner there. You want something cold to put on it?\n\nJAKE: Yes, please.\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Ah, well the name is Charles Crooshtoost, and I bring milk to man! What year could I get you, son?\n\nJAKE: Anything that's cold.\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: In my hand right now, I've got a vintage September 1242.\n\nJAKE: No, that sounds like it's way too old.\n\nBEN: Well...\n\nJAKE: It's antique milk.\n\nBEN: Who knows?\n\n[Amir shrugs.]\n\nJAKE: It's poison.\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Where's the shiner?\n\nJAKE: It's right here.\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Milkman, milkman, milkman!\n\nJAKE: Yes, thank you, thank you--\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST [pouring chunky milk all over Jake's head] Here we go, and now we're feeling good in the hood! We're feeling good in the hood.\n\nJAKE: What the fuck are you--\n\nSTANLEY: You're wasting all that cow juice!\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Way to go, gotta go!\n\nJAKE: ...Why did you do that?\n\nDOCTOR: Guys, I am a doctor. Everybody calm down. You shouldn't be pouring old milky cottage cheese on your face. Take the cold glass, and put it against your face!\n\nJAKE: Yeah, I know.\n\nAMIR: You should have listened to the doctor, Jake.\n\nJAKE: Don't.\n\nSULU CANDLES: [singing and dancing] I hear we're writing a movie, I hear we're writing a movie! I hear we're writing a movie... but first, let's eat a snack!\n\n[Sulu Candles throws a bag of candy at Jake, and it hits him in the face.]\n\nSTANLEY: You could have caught it if you had fingers, cow!\n\nJAKE: This is the worst day of my life.\n\nBEN: Ugh... what about the day you got your dick sucked?\n\nJAKE: ...That was up there too.\n\nBEN: Right.\n\nAMIR: The attempted dick-sucking.\n\nJAKE: Attem-- it happened.\n\nBEN: Sure.\n\nJAKE: Get that through your head.\n\nBEN: Sure.\n\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: Oh, what's my name?\n\nAMIR: Geez, how many people live here? How'd you find this place?\n\nBEN: Actually, Cherry Dude found it for us, and he moved in.\n\nCHERRY DUDE: It was either this or a cupcake in La Cienega that'll drive ya wild!\n\nAMIR: I'd be down to live in a cupcake.\n\nJAKE: You already live in a muffin, [to Cherry Dude] thanks to you.\n\nCHERRY DUDE: Movin' on!\n\nBEN: Everybody, listen up: Jake and Amir are here because they want to write a web series, and they need a little help with the first episode.\n\nJOPE: Ooh, I'll DJ the premiere party. What about this... [singing] Hey, yo, my name is Drake... do you know my buddy Samuel... he's got a Razor scooter... go, Samuel, you're doing it!\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: And I will bring the milk!\n\nJAKE: Nobody drinks milk at parties.\n\n[As Charles Crooshtoost is talking, Sulu Candles tries to make Jake flinch with the bag of candy.]\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Okay, how old are the kids going to your parties? \"Nobody drinks milk at parties\"!\n\nJAKE: Do you party with children?\n\nBEN: Jake, why are you taking the wind out of everybody's sails? [to Amir] Is he always like this?\n\nJAKE: [gesturing to Charles Crooshtoost] He's a pedophile.\n\nAMIR: He's-- he's literally always negative to me, and he's always bringing me down.\n\nBEN: Oh my God. You know what? You have to start saying \"yes, and\" to things. That's how comedy works. You build upon things.\n\n[The interrogator returns.]\n\nINTERROGATOR: That's right, you piece of shit. So stop saying no and start saying yes! [lunges at Jake's pants]\n\nJAKE: Get out of here! Hey-- Ow! Get off of me, man!\n\nINTERROGATOR: Fine! It may be illegal now, but it won't be for long!\n\nJAKE: It's always gonna be against the law to do that.\n\nINTERROGATOR: [leaving] Oh, we'll see. My dad's in the Senate.\n\nJAKE: Alright, look, stop it. You guys can all help. Just one idea at a time, and no blowing me.\n\nBEN: Oh.\n\nAMIR: Or...\n\nBEN: Or?\n\nAMIR: ...everyone pitch their ideas at the same time and we get out of here fifty times quicker.\n\nBEN: So smart. Let's do that. I'll get my laptop. Let's go over here.\n\nJAKE: Not smart. It's actually a dumb idea.\n\n[Amir follows Ben and makes a two-person conga line.]\n\nBEN: [sitting down at his laptop] Everybody, on your marks, get set, go!\n\n[All of Ben's roommates begin talking over each other. Most of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony.]\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: Fade up, on Charles Crooshtoost...\n\nSULU CANDLES: Open on a movie theater...\n\nCHERRY DUDE: ...in Wilshire. There he is...\n\nJOPE: ...What are they doing? They're trying to...\n\nCHARLES CROOSHTOOST: [singing] ...Hail to the milkman, the milkman, the milkman! Hail to the milkman, the milkman is me!...\n\nSCALBYLAUSUS JIM: ...never been stretched before. What are these called? Elbows...\n\nSULU CANDLES: ...all the snacks to themselves! What am I gonna do? How am I gonna do it?...\n\nSTANLEY: ...and strikes the defender! \"Whoa, cow,\" he says, \"whoa!\"\n\nSULU CANDLES: ...What are we gonna do?...\n\n[Ben and Amir both type on the computer, and Amir laughs maniacally at what they're writing.]\n\n[A title card reads \"4 Hours Later\". Jake has toweled the milk off his face.]\n\nBEN: Done! ...Perfect, we did it!\n\nJAKE: No it's not. I didn't get a word in edgewise, guys. How many pages is this thing?\n\nBEN: Yeah-- it is... four hundred and two pages, but, to be fair, it is double-sided.\n\nJAKE: That is 804, then.\n\nBEN: Yeah, but you know what? I just double-checked it: it's way over a thousand.\n\nAMIR: That's okay. It's better to have over a thousand pages of garbage than four pages of gold.\n\nBEN: Yeah.\n\nJAKE: Completely disagree.\n\nBEN: Hey, what do you guys say about a wrap party, huh?\n\n[Ben hits a key, and Stony's remix \"The Milkman\" begins playing. Scalbylausus Jim and Sulu Candles start dancing, and Charles Crooshtoost mouths along to the words.]\n\nJAKE: [as Ben and Amir dance] How is this possible? These are sound clips from our actual lives.\n\n[A montage begins, set to \"The Milkman\", featuring outtakes from all of the episodes in which Ben Schwartz appeared.]\n\nLYRICS: (as in the video)  \n\nListen up, everybody, this is the guy  \n\nThat sucked my dick, sucked my dick\n\nMilkman please, milkman please  \n\nA glass of your least expired milk  \n\nAbsolutely, I have July 13th (That's good, that's good)  \n\n1991 (Mmm, even better)\n\nListen up, everybody, this is the guy  \n\nThat sucked my dick, sucked my dick  \n\n(Listen up, everybody!)

Why are you wearing that?\n\nAMIR: [jutting his golf bag out] Golf clubs!\n\nJAKE: Do you think I said \"What are you wearing\"? I said \"Why\".\n\nAMIR: I'm trying to be relatable, dimwit. You know, this is actually a pretty big problem you have: You often reject my shit at the face without really trying to understand and grasp the subtle nuance behind it. Zoom out!\n\nJAKE: We're meeting with high-power producers, trying to get them to give us money to fund the insane script that you wrote. The least you can do is act like a professional.\n\nAMIR: [imitating Christian Bale] Are you professional?\n\nJAKE: ...Stop with the Christian Bale shit.\n\nAMIR: Sorry!\n\nJAKE: It happened--\n\nAMIR: I just learned about it.\n\n[The two producers, later referred to as Lyle and Blanche, show up.

I'm bored.\n\nAMIR: So am I. Blanche, Lyle, I apologize for my... insanely boring colleague. He doesn't realize that from him, even a little bit is too much.\n\nBLANCHE: Agreed.\n\nAMIR: But pass me the conch. [holding up his hand, which is in an actual conch] Allow me to beat your eardrums for just a minute here...\n\nLYLE: Please. Your friend is tedious.\n\nJAKE: Enough, Lyle.\n\nAMIR: My father was a quiet man. Proud. Growing up, we moved... a lot.

I'm sorry, but we reject your offer. It's not only a drop in the bucket, but it's a slap in the face. Lyle, you've underplayed your hand!\n\nLYLE: Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you knew how to play hardball. Can't blame an old exec for trying!\n\nAMIR: But you can teach one new tricks.\n\n[Lyle and Blanche laugh at length.]\n\nJAKE: It wasn't that good.\n\nBLANCHE: A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, cash in hand.

It is full of bills.]\n\nAMIR: Though I'll tell you right now we're not accepting it, because we want complete creative control, Lyle!\n\n[Amir lights a match and throws it into the bag.

There has to be some oversight!\n\nAMIR: The only oversight here is you, Lyle. As in: I'm over the sight... of your jowly face. [to Blanche] Of your... old pussy.

Amir has a megaphone.]\n\nAMIR: [patting Jake on the knee] Good shoot, as they say! Good shoot!\n\nJAKE: Can you please not? Alright? That was an absolutely harrowing experience.\n\nAMIR: Nobody said making art would be easy.\n\nJAKE: You cut off your own dick today, man.\n\nAMIR: [through the megaphone] Excuse...?\n\nJAKE: You stepped out of your trailer in front of a huge plume of crystal meth smoke. You strode onto the set, put your penis through the slate, and said \"'The Entire Crew Screams and Calls 911', take two,\" and slammed the device on your shaft. Your genitals hit the floor with a sickening slap, and everyone stood in stunned silence for an eternity.\n\n[Amir accidentally sets off the megaphone's siren, but turns it off. Jake snatches it away from him.]\n\nAMIR: Oh!\n\nJAKE: You never stopped smiling through the whole entire thing, even as you bled out through the stump on your mound, even as the paramedics arrived, and failed to reattach your reproductive organ. You kept yelling, \"I'll be a better director as a eunuch! My libido won't guide my eye!\"\n\n[Amir gestures along as Jake quotes him, raising his arms for emphasis and then pointing at his eye.]\n\nAMIR: I'm sorry if I went dickless for Michael Chiklis. I'm serious. [air quotes] I apologize if I \"inconvenienced anybody\".\n\nJAKE: You inconvenienced everybody. Eventually, you convinced the paramedics to attach your big toe to your pelvic bone to use as your phallus. You said \"as long as it's chubby, a girl will rubby\". I will never forget that weird rhyme as long as I live.\n\nAMIR: Huh... Thank you--\n\nJAKE: Not a compliment. You also rented an IMAX camera, for no reason. That's a hundred thousand dollars, for the day, out of our budget, and you didn't even shoot anything interesting! You laid it on the ground, and paraded a bunch of construction paper dinosaurs around in front of it.\n\nAMIR: [holding a paper pterodactyl out in front of him] Welcome, to Jurassic Shart?\n\nJAKE: So dumb. Don't--\n\n[Amir grunts and squirms for a long time, and shits without farting. He throws the pterodactyl down in frustration.]\n\nJAKE: Great. You shit your pants without farting. So it's not even a shart; it's just a shit.\n\nAMIR: [frustrated] Anal!\n\nJAKE: What are you gonna do without a penis?\n\nAMIR: Let me ask: Why are you so fixated on that small part of the day?\n\nJAKE: \"Fixated on that\"... it's a small part of you.\n\nAMIR: A lot of other stuff happened, by the way!\n\nJAKE: You know what? I'm fixated because you castrated yourself publicly!\n\nAMIR: [sarcastically] Oooooh!\n\nJAKE: Yeah! Yeah, you ruined today! We didn't get any good footage!\n\nAMIR: It's there in pieces!\n\nJAKE: Your penis is in pieces!\n\nAMIR: Excuse you! Absolutely excuse you!\n\nJAKE: Excuse you. You monster.\n\nAMIR: By the way, whatever we didn't get today, we pick up tomorrow! That's why it's called a pick-up!\n\nJAKE: What money do we shoot the pick-ups with? You blew the entire budget! A hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars gone, spent on an IMAX camera and a lunch comprised entirely of bird's nest soup! It's a Chinese delicacy. It cost forty-five hundred dollars a bowl, which of course meant we didn't even get to feed the entire crew of fifty people.\n\nAMIR: [holding up a finger to stop Jake] I had a KIND bar.\n\nJAKE: Oh good!
